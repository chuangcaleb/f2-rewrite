# Frozen 2 Rewrite

The initial project started in 21 Dec 2019, after watching the movie twice in early December. There was a lot of nearly-there's in the movie, and rather than criticizing the rushed production and clunky dialogue, I wrote a full story/script rewrite.

It was my first time writing and realizing a movie length story, even if an “alternative universe fanfiction”. There were a lot of writing techniques applied and skills developed.

## Key Points

- Aligned and synergized the climaxes of Elsa’s and Anna’s arcs
  - Elsa sees someone else in Ahtohallan
- Refocused the themes and motifs of the story
- Ensured constant ticking-time bomb and antagonistic force:
  - Antagonism personified by a human, Runeard
- Concrete plot/scene objectives
- Kristoff isn’t a himbo anymore, he contributes way more with his subplot arcs with Anna and Mattias
  - Mattias isn’t a plot device, he contributes more
- Made magic out of plot holes
- Reworked the lore
- Fleshed out objectives and conflict of our two factions in the Forest
- Everyone has personal callbacks to F1 during this quest
- We see new opinions on events of Frozen 1
- Cut down on action screen time for story development

## The Screenplay

After discovering [Fountain – A markup language for screenwriting](https://fountain.io/), I needed a story to practice writing with. I also wanted to see the rewrite in screenplay format.

## Build Task

The one Fountain file we work on is very very long, and navigating to specific scenes/sections is quite awkward and clumsy, slowly scrolling until we reach the target. It's just the way Fountain itself works.

I use VS Code and [Better Fountain](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain) as my writing tools. Because of VS Code's versatile features, I have come up with a custom Build Task script that combines (I wouldn't say compile, per se) individual files from a source directory, organized by the principle of separation of responsibilities, into one output file. This repository is a sample showcase of this custom build script.
