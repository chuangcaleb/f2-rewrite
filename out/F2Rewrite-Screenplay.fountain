# ACT 1


## 1 - Lullabies

### The Royal Family

EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE - NIGHT (PAST) #1#

ESTABLISHING. A developing nation, nestled at the mouth of a deep fjord.

INT. ARENDELLE PALACE, ELSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT #2#

Though set in a palace, the bedroom looks -- feels -- very much like our own.

AGNARR (O.S.)
Anna! Elsa!

IDUNA (O.S.)
Bed time's soon!

Normal parents calling their normal children to bed, except for the...

PAN TO:

.SNOWFLAKES  #3#

that fill the air -- there's a SNOW PLAYGROUND in the middle of the room. ELSA (8) and ANNA (5) are way past their bedtime.

YOUNG ANNA
Uh oh! The princess is trapped in the goblin's evil spell! But the Snow Queen comes to her rescue! Quick, Elsa, make a prince, a fancy one!

Elsa waves her hand, and conjures up a new ICE FIGURINE to add into their world.

YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
Oh no, the prince is stuck too! Who cares about danger when there's *love*?

YOUNG ELSA
(squirming)
Anna, kissing won't save the forest! The Lost Fairies are crying out!
(mimicking elephant trumpets)
What sound does a giraffe make? Nevermind! They wake the princess, and together with the Snow Queen they break the spell and save everyone!

YOUNG ANNA
And they all get married!

The parents -- also the King and Queen of Arendelle -- step through the doorframe and close the door behind them.

AGNARR
What are you playing?

YOUNG ANNA
Enchanted Forest!

AGNARR
That's like no Enchanted Forest I've ever seen.

YOUNG ELSA
(gasps)
You've seen an Enchanted Forest?

AGNARR
I have. Once.

YOUNG ANNA
And you never told us this before?!

AGNARR
(gesturing)
Well, I could tell you now... If you...

YOUNG ELSA
Okay, tell us now!

IDUNA
(to Agnarr)
Are you sure about this?

AGNARR
No more secrets - it's time they know.

YOUNG ANNA
(whispering)
Let's make a big snowman later!

Agnarr draws a deep breath as the sisters look on in uncontrollable curiosity.

>ZOOM IN ON:

.THE SNOW PLAYGROUND #4#

Agnarr fashions Elsa's ICE FIGURINES and playground to tell his story, SINGING an old Arendellian song. The ice figurines start to move on their own.

### Agnarr's Arendellian Warning

>~"There Once Was A King" (New)<

AGNARR
~THERE ONCE WAS A KING OF ARENDELLE
~KING RUNEARD LED HIS KINGDOM WELL
~BUT ONE GRAVE FAULT LET ARENDELLE FELL
~KING RUNEARD: KING OF ARENDELLE

The RUNEARD FIGURINE leads a group of other figurines to a new area, which bursts into colorful autumn hues.

A RIVER cuts through the forest while smaller figurines call Runeard over to it.

AGNARR (CONT'D)
~THERE ONCE WAS A NATION FAR AWAY
~NORTHULDRA HAD A MAGICAL ARRAY
~AN ENCHANTED FOREST HELD A RIVER WHERE CHILDREN PLAY
~THEY PROMISED FRIENDSHIP FROM THAT DAY

Runeard orchestrates and finishes the building of a giant DAM on the river. A celebration starts - but not for long.

AGNARR (CONT'D)
~THERE ONCE WAS A GIFT OF PEACE TO BUILD
~A DAM TO STRENGTHEN WATERS, LAND AND FIELD
~A FEAST WAS THROWN - WE LET DOWN OUR SHIELD
~THAT'S WHEN NORTHULDRA'S SECRET HATE REVEALED

The once-vibrant playground DARKENS as River tendrils SNATCHES up people.

Heavy snow falls like ASH and looming GIANTS wreck havoc.

A whirlwind of MIST covers the land from view, trapping it in a DOME of cloud.

AGNARR (CONT'D)
~THE FOREST QUAKED
~THE RIVER ROSE AND SEALED
~THE SKY ABOVE IS CLOSING IN
~OUR FEARFUL PEOPLE SPILLED

A small figurine pours out of the blizzard dome and floats down a shallow river into a familiar fjord.

The visibly traumatized BOY washes up on some docks, picked up by soldiers who recognize him.

AGNARR (CONT'D)
~ONE BOY ESCAPED, SWEPT BY A SWELL
~HE WAS FOUND AND LIVED TO TELL

The boy looks out from the docks, waiting, as an elder passes him an orb and scepter. He hesitantly takes them.

AGNARR (CONT'D)
~PRINCE AGNARR...
~NEW KING OF ARENDELLE

DISSOLVE TO:

.AGNARR #5#

looks sadly upon the scene, and then to his children.

AGNARR (CONT'D)
~THERE ONCE WAS A KING OF ARENDELLE
~HE WAS LOST, TRAPPED IN A MAGIC SPELL
~HE FLEW TOO CLOSE - HE GUARD HAD FELL
~THERE ONCE WAS A KING OF ARENDELLE


ANNA
(beat) Fairy tales should have happy endings!

Elsa looked down at her own hands, her own magic - which Agnarr notices, and takes her hand into his.

AGNARR (CONT'D)
I believe the mist keeps Arendelle safe by keeping *in* all the dangers of the Forest, so it never comes out.
(pause)
That's why since then, Arendelle practices the mantra: conceal, don't feel -- keep your guard up.

Anna, cross-armed, is not buying it. Iduna smiles and wraps her naive child in her arms.

But Elsa leans in to her father.

AGNARR (CONT'D)
The future Queen of Arendelle must know this very well: some fears can be healthy, especially when they have hurt us before.

Elsa reaches out to hug Agnarr... which he carefully reciprocates. This is the tragic reality of this family.

### Parents Find The Map

KNOCK KNOCK

A younger KAI, the loyal overseer and chief assistant, appears in the doorframe without permission.

Agnarr glares at Kai -- he's having a moment here. But he softens when he notices an urgency.

Kai holds up a large parchment: the AHTOHALLAN MAP.

KAI
We found it. In the library. A map to Ahtohallan.

The monarchs turn to each other. Their glances exchange doubt... calculation... then, mutual agreement.

Agnarr gets up to follow Kai, shuffling a worried Elsa over to Iduna, and he closes the door behind him.

KAI (O.S.)
But it's in some unknown language.

The room is bathed in darkness once again.

YOUNG ELSA
Mama...? Is all this why... why I'm... cur --

YOUNG ANNA
-- the most beautiful, wonderful, perfect-ful person in the whole wide world!!

Anna does a little jig before throwing herself on her sister. They giggle, but then look to their mother, still waiting for an answer.

IDUNA
We don't know. But Papa and I, we will find out, together.

Anna, unsatisfied, huffs and spreads herself wide on the bed.

YOUNG ANNA
Great, now I can't sleep.

Elsa thumped backwards on the bed too, but noticeably very unsettled.

Iduna looks at both of them, then reclines on the backboards of the bed, pulling her children upright and onto herself. Iduna SINGS her own lullaby.

### Iduna's Cryptic Lullaby

>~"All is Found" (Unchanged)<

IDUNA
~WHERE THE NORTH WIND MEETS THE SEA
~THERE'S A RIVER FULL OF MEMORY
~SLEEP MY DARLING SAFE AND SOUND
~FOR IN THIS RIVER ALL IS FOUND

Throughout the lullaby, Anna easily dozes off from exhaustion. Iduna picks her up and tucks her in her own bed, closing her drooling mouth.

She comes back to pick up and cradle Elsa, then looks out of the window.

IDUNA
~IN HER WATERS, DEEP AND TRUE
LIE THE ANSWERS AND A PATH FOR YOU
~DIVE DOWN DEEP INTO HER SOUND
~BUT NOT TOO FAR OR YOU'LL BE DROWNED

EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE - NIGHT #6#

We sweep up across the fjord... then pan up to the Northern Lights filling the sky...

TITLE CARD: "FROZEN II"

IDUNA
~YES SHE WILL SING TO THOSE WHO HEAR
~AND IN HER SONG, ALL MAGIC FLOWS
~BUT CAN YOU BRAVE WHAT YOU MOST FEAR
~CAN YOU FACE WHAT THE RIVER KNOWS?

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE - DAY (PRESENT) #7#

Autumn maple leaves flutter across our view as we travel down the fjord, across the water, and we see:

THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE

growing larger as we approach it. It has expanded and grown since the past; notably, its walls are now adorned with snowflake decorations. Fleets of trading ships fill its docks.

IDUNA
~WHERE THE NORTH WIND MEETS THE SEA
~THERE'S A RIVER FULL OF MEMORY
~SLEEP MY DARLING SAFE AND SOUND
~FOR IN THIS RIVER ALL IS FOUND

## 2 - I Wants

### Elsa's Worries

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, HALL BALCONY - DAY #8#

Elsa, now 24, stands on a balcony of the palace, looking northwards up the fjord. Seemingly recalling the lullaby as if a flashback.

She holds out a large parchment, trying to make sense of it all... until she hears:

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

Elsa bursts a few ice shards across the balustrade in surprise.

KAI
(unfazed)
Your Majesty?

ELSA
Oh! Kai! ...You didn't hear that?

KAI
Uh, are you alright, my Queen?

ELSA
Just... so excited for today! Yes -- what is it?

KAI
I just wanted to inform you that the last shipment of supplies for the Festival has only just arrived because of the drying fjord.

They both look out towards the

FJORD SHORELINE

which was receding along the fjord -- docks towered too high, while fishermen stood in shallow waters. Back on the

HALL BALCONY

the Queen ushered her chief assistant off hastily.

ELSA
(grinning)
Thank you, Kai.

Kai walks off, concerned but obedient. Elsa turns her attention back to the parchment in her hands: it is the same AHTOHALLAN MAP from previously.

And, we see additional HANDWRITING on it.

ELSA (CONT'D)
(reading aloud)
The river found but lost. Magic source. Elsa's source? ...A way to lift the curse?

Elsa shuts her eyes.

ELSA (CONT'D)
You sailed through the Dark Sea to find a way to cure me.

She looks up to the sky.

ELSA (CONT'D)
Mother... what do I do?

### Anna and Olaf and Arendelle

EXT. ARENDELLE PLAZA - DAY #9#
The square is busy with people decorating and stringing banners. A large STATUE OF KING RUNEARD marks the center.

Anna, now 21, walks a group of officials through the plaza, projecting her vision through wild hand gestures.

ANNA
...and it'll be crazy! Alright, let's make this the best Autumn Festival that Arendelle has ever seen!

The officials disperse.

OLAF, a sentient jolly snowman, is sunbathing on a picnic cloth on a patch of grass nearby.

ANNA
Olaf! Enjoying your new permafrost?

OLAF
I'm just living the dream, Anna. Oh, how I wish this could last forever.
And yet change mocks us with her beauty...

ANNA
What's that?

OLAF
(all regal)
Forgive me, maturity is making me poetic. Tell me, you're older and thus all-knowing. Do you ever worry about the notion that, nothing is permanent?

ANNA
Uh... no...

OLAF
Really? Wow, I can't wait till I'm aged like you, so I don't have to worry about important things.

ANNA
(giggles)
That's not what I mean. I don't worry because... well, I have you, and Elsa, and Kristoff, and Sven and the gates are open wide and... and I'm not alone anymore.

>~"Some Things Never Change" (Rewritten)<

ANNA
(singing)
~YES, THE WIND BLOWS A LITTLE BIT COLDER

OLAF
~AND WE'RE ALL GETTING OLDER

ANNA
~AND THE CLOUDS ARE MOVING ON WITH EVERY AUTUMN BREEZE
~PETER PUMPKIN JUST BECAME FERTILIZER

OLAF
~AND MY LEAF'S A LITTLE SADDER AND WISER

ANNA
~THAT'S WHY I RELY ON CERTAIN CERTAINTIES

They walk down a road and through a house frame while people are pulling it up.

Olaf's head gets caught on it, but recovers, and Anna leads him off by the hand.

ANNA
~YES, SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE
~LIKE THE FEEL OF YOUR HAND IN MINE
~SOME THINGS STAY THE SAME

They quickly walk past a painter scolding a man who just chopped down his tree.

BOTH
~LIKE HOW WE GET ALONG JUST FINE!

Olaf skips on a mossy stone wall, when it slips. He falls on a handcar, which runs down the track.

Anna runs to pull a lever, causing the handcar to hit a wall and Olaf flying into her arms.

ANNA
~LIKE AN OLD STONE WALL THAT'LL NEVER FALL
~SOME THINGS ARE ALWAYS TRUE
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE
~LIKE HOW I'M HOLDING ON TIGHT TO YOU

### Kristoff's Plans

EXT. ARENDELLE MARKETPLACE - DAY #10#

The marketplace is stocked with all kinds of bright-coloured exotic fruit, while stalls are lined with autumnal Arendelle pennons.

KRISTOFF and SVEN, a man with his best-friend, dog-like reindeer with a love for carrots, stroll down the street.

KRISTOFF
~THE LEAVES ARE ALREADY FALLING
~SVEN, **A CHANGE IN** THE FUTURE IS CALLING

Kristoff opens a RING BOX and shows off a PROPOSAL RING to Sven on bended knee... while onlookers look away. Sven nods in glee.

KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
~ARE YOU TELLING ME TONIGHT YOU'RE GONNA GET DOWN ON ONE KNEE?
(as Kristoff)
~YEAH, BUT, I'M REALLY BAD AT PLANNING THESE THINGS OUT
~LIKE CANDLELIGHT AND PULLING OF RINGS OUT
(as Sven)
~MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE ALL THE ROMANTIC STUFF TO ME

EXT. ARENDELLE PLAZA, OAKEN'S STALL - DAY #11#

Sven pushes Kristoff to OAKEN'S pedicure stall. They file his nails and massage his shoulders.

KRISTOFF (as himself) (CONT'D)
~YEAH, SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE
~LIKE THE LOVE THAT I FEEL **FROM** HER

The pair go around town to find nice clothes for Kristoff.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~SOME THINGS STAY THE SAME
~LIKE HOW REINDEERS ARE EASIER
~BUT IF I COMMIT AND I GO FOR IT

EXT. ARENDELLE SHOP - DAY #12#

The sun starts to set as they step out of the shop, and Kristoff holds out his POEM BOOK -- which he's hoping to woo Anna with.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I'LL KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND DO
(speaking)
Right?
(as Sven)
~SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE
(worriedly, as himself)
~SVEN, **I HOPE THAT SHE SAYS "I DO"**

They bump into Anna and Olaf in the square, and embrace excitedly.

### Elsa's Resolve

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, ELSA's BEDROOM, BALCONY - DAY #13#

Elsa is still bothered, expecting something to arrive.

ELSA
~THE WINDS ARE RESTLESS
~COULD THAT BE WHY I'M HEARING THIS CALL?
~*THE FJORD IS DRYING*
~*I WISH I KNEW THE TRUTH BEHIND IT ALL*

.FROM HER BALCONY #14#

she looks over her prosperous kingdom. And then at the gang laughing with each other in the plaza.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~THESE DAYS ARE PRECIOUS
~CAN'T LET THEM SLIP AWAY

She resolves a determined face and runs down as quick as possible.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~I CAN'T FREEZE THIS MOMENT
~BUT I CAN STILL GO OUT AND SEIZE THIS DAY

### Final Festival Preparations

EXT. ARENDELLE BALCONIES - DAY #15#

Arendellians string the pennons along their houses. Anna accidentally holds up someone's clothesline and underwear, abashed.

EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS - DAY #16#

Fishermen transport live fish from a basket, bucket-brigade style, but Olaf tosses the fish he gets back into the sea.

EXT. ARENDELLE PLAZA - DAY #17#

Anna and Elsa meet up excitedly in the middle of the plaza. The whole nation joins in the final preparations!

ARENDELLIANS
~THE WIND BLOWS A LITTLE BIT COLDER

OLAF
(to camera)
~AND YOU ALL LOOK A LITTLE BIT OLDER

Anna and Kristoff spread out a table cloth, while Oaken plumps down a huge pumpkin onto it.

ANNA
~IT'S TIME TO COUNT OUR BLESSINGS

ANNA AND KRISTOFF
~BENEATH AN AUTUMN SKY

On the long feast table, Arendellians of all ages lay out a stunning display of dishes and fruits.

.AROUND THE STATUE OF KING RUNEARD #18#

The sisters call the people to gather round.

ARENDELLIANS
~WE'RE ALWAYS LIVING THE KINGDOM APLENTY
~THAT STANDS FOR THE GOOD OF THE MANY

An excited Anna bounces uncontrollably as Elsa sends a ice bolt into the air,

.AGAINST THE FLAG OF ARENDELLE #19#

held by the STATUE OF KING RUNEARD. The ice bolt explodes into bright, beautiful fireworks!

ELSA
~AND I PROMISE YOU THE FLAG OF ARENDELLE WILL ALWAYS FLY

ANNA
~OUR FLAG WILL ALWAYS FLY

ARENDELLIANS
~OUR FLAG WILL ALWAYS FLY
~OUR FLAG WILL ALWAYS FLY

### The Autumn Festival

EXT. ARENDELLE STREETS - NIGHT #20#

Anna passes a dish with one sole carrot to Olaf, who promptly takes the carrot before Sven -- but give him his nose instead!

ALL
~SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE
~TURN AROUND AND THE TIME HAS FLOWN

Children line up to whisper requests to Elsa -- who makes toys out of ice for them!

ALL
~SOME THINGS STAY THE SAME
~THOUGH THE FUTURE REMAINS UNKNOWN

Everyone joins in a massive line dance, just having a great time.

ALL (CONT'D)
~MAY OUR GOOD LUCK LAST
~MAY OUR PAST BE PAST

EXT. ARENDELLE PLAZA - EVENING #21#

As a TIMELAPSE is set against a CLOCK TOWER, night falls and everyone helps to clean up the feast.

ALL (CONT'D)
~TIME'S MOVING FAST, IT'S TRUE

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, GATES - NIGHT #22#

The GANG walk home and approach the gates, exhausted from a long day.

THE GANG
~SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE

Anna affirms to each member one-by-one as they walk past her into the gates.

ANNA
~AND I'M HOLDING ON TIGHT TO YOU

She hugs it out with Elsa in a tight embrace.

ELSA
~HOLDING ON TIGHT TO YOU

Olaf rides in on Sven's head...

OLAF
~HOLDING ON TIGHT TO YOU

Kristoff notices the perfect atmosphere, the climax to a great day... he fumbles for his proposal ring...

KRISTOFF
~HOLDING ON TIGHT TO YOU

But Kristoff is accidentally dragged away by Sven's antlers. He frantically aborts the mission and books it.

Anna, oblivious(?) to all that, just basks in the moment.

ANNA
~I'M HOLDING ON TIGHT TO YOU

Anna turns around and walks into the gates, which do not get shut behind her.

## 3 - Proposal

### Kristoff's Rehearsal

INT. ARENDELLE PALACE, LOUNGE ROOM - NIGHT #23#

A regal room with dimmed lanterns and paintings of established people hanging on the wall.

KRISTOFF
(stuttering, to camera)
Roses are red, crocus are purple;
(peeking at book)
My love for you... will be eternal.
Your love for me... is deeper than the sea;
Princess Anna of Arendelle, will you marry me?

Kristoff is in full royal garb: hair, GLOVES and all. He's down on bended knee and holding out an open ring box, flashing his best, but awkward, toothy smile.

We see it is actually Sven looking back at him, offering a consolatory smile, equally as goofy.

KRISTOFF (AS SVEN)
For the hundredth time today, yes, Kristoff! I will marry you!

Sven perks up, and nudges the ring box.

KRISTOFF (AS KRISTOFF)
Now let me -- wait, where's the ring?!

The duo drop to their knees, both sniffing bloodhound-style. Kristoff dives under a cabinet and holds up the ring.

KRISTOFF
Phew! There it is!

Kristoff falls back on a couch and sets the ring box on a table, burying his head in his hands.

KRISTOFF
If I lost it, Sven, I would need to sell off the new sleigh!

### Kristoff's Surprise Visit

ANNA (O.S.)
Hey, that sleigh was a gift!

Kristoff and Sven are caught off guard -- they scramble.

Somehow Kristoff is caught on Sven's antlers and is launched up onto and caught upside-down on the chandelier.

Anna and Olaf just turn the corner.

The boys flail wildly -- then freeze in place, striking a casual pose.

KRISTOFF
AHHH! Hi.
(grins)

ANNA
Hey.
(gentler)
Do you need help --

KRISTOFF
I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.

ANNA
Are you sure?

KRISTOFF
(contemplating)
...Yeah.

Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to join the conversation.

OLAF
You hesitated.

KRISTOFF
I just wasn't looking where I was going. But I'm okay.

Anna tilts her head in amusement.

ANNA
Does the air seem a bit thin to you up there?

They all laugh at the callback. Kristoff wheezes a bit too hard from the blood rush.

OLAF
(deadbeat)
Oh yeah, he totally needs help.

Anna looks to Kristoff... who relents his pride, and nods. Anna pulls herself onto Sven.

ANNA
Take my hand!

They both extend their hands. Anna launches herself to grab hold of and swing Kristoff.

It dislodges him but tears his nice suit in the process.

Anna lands feet first, catching a falling Kristoff in her arms. They tumble into a mess on the ground as the chandelier swings around.

ANNA
That was like a crazy trust exercise.

They bask in the embrace. But then Kristoff realizes:

KRISTOFF
Ngaw... the suit was on rental...

ANNA
Yeah, what's with the fancy suits and selling sleighs?

### Kristoff's Proposal

Kristoff and Sven send frantic eye signals to each other, having a full-on conversation. Anna and Olaf watch curiously.

They reach some conclusion, because Kristoff pulls Anna up to her feet and gets down on one knee himself.

ANNA
Oh?

He dares one last glance at his poem book -- no, it's too late for last minute revision -- and he takes a deep, shaky breath, and begins his POEM.

KRISTOFF
(nervously)
Crocus are blue...
Violets are... blue...
The sea... the sea...

Kristoff tries to gulp down and it causes an involuntary gag reflex.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
(sighs, resigned)
...the sea is also blue.

Olaf and Sven hide their faces in secondhand shame.

ANNA
Kristoff --

KRISTOFF
(mumbling)
Why is this so hard?

ANNA
Kristoff, I --

KRISTOFF
No -- no, no, no!

Kristoff SINGS.


>~"Get This Right" (Unchanged Outtake)<

KRISTOFF
~IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME
~THE TIMING AND THE SETTING AREN'T WHAT I THOUGHT THEY'D BE

Kristoff looks away for a moment, staring off into the distance. Anna pokes out and studies him.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~THERE'S PROBABLY SOMEONE BETTER FOR YOU OUT THERE ANYWAY
~MAYBE I JUST NEED SOME SPACE
~NO, I SHOULD JUST COME OUT AND SAY

He turns back, optimistic, and takes Anna by the hand and spins into her arms.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I WANNA GET THIS RIGHT, BABY
~I WANNA THRILL YOU IN THE WAY YOU DESERVE

He whips out a top hat and pulls out a wilted bouquet of flowers. He laughs nervously, throws both aside, and inches away, contemplating to bail.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I WANNA BLOW YOUR MIND, DARLING
~I'M JUST HAVING TROUBLE GETTING UP THE NERVE

He turns back with melted chocolates from his pockets... that's not gonna work. He tosses away his stained gloves.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I WANNA GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT
~I WANNA BE THE MAN YOU CHOOSE

He straightens out his torn-up suit and sweeps up Anna in his arms -- but still woozy, pukes in the nearest vase.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I WANNA SWEEP YOU OFF YOUR FEET
~WITHOUT PUKING ON YOUR SHOES

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, PATIO - NIGHT #24#

Kristoff pulls her out a door to a beautiful candlelight supper setting. Lanterns stream in all directions.

Anna is impressed.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~MAYBE I'LL DO BETTER IN THE CANDLELIGHT
~I GOTTA GET THIS RIGHT

A candlestick drops onto the table. It catches fire.

Kristoff throws it out of sight where it clearly bursts into flames.

KRISTOFF (SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
No, no, stay where you are. I'll put out the fire, my love.

Kristoff dips Anna. She giggles. Score!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I WANNA MAKE YOU SWOON, BABY

INT. ARENDELLE PALACE, SNOW ROOM - NIGHT #25#

Kristoff brings Anna to the top of a SNOW CASTLE that reaches the ceiling, kept cool by towers of ice blocks.

Anna shivers but looks around, and Kristoff does a victory dance -- not seeing Anna sinking into the snow.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I WANNA ROCK YOU WITH MY RIGHTEOUS ROMANCE

INT. ARENDELLE PALACE, COMMON ROOM - CONTINUOUS #26#

Anna falls into a sofa chair, and was startled.

There, Kristoff is on his side against the fireplace and pours out wine, which spill.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I WANNA SET A MOOD, DARLING

He swings his legs all around to fan them.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~BUT I'M SWEATING THROUGH THE SEAT OF THESE PANTS

ANNA (SPOKEN)
Are you okay?

INT. ARENDELLE PALACE, THEATER - CONTINUOUS #27#

Anna is pulled forward from her sofa chair into the front row seat of a mini-theater -- and Kristoff the sole performer on stage.

Kristoff tosses aside his poem book. He pulls out a lute, but its strings snap upon first strum.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I HAD PLANNED TO READ A POEM
~I THOUGHT I'D PLAY A LITTLE LUTE

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, PATIO - NIGHT #28#

Set before blurry candle lights, Kristoff gets down on one knee. Anna squeals.

Kristoff checks every pocket but doesn't find the ring.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~OOH, HERE'S A THING
~I'VE GOT A RING
~I DIDN'T BRING?
~OH, SHOOT!

He picks himself up, not making eye contact, and walks away ashamed.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~SO, THIS WENT VERY WELL, GOODNIGHT
~I DIDN'T GET THIS RIGHT

ANNA (SPOKEN)
Kristoff! It's okay! Come back!

### Kristoff's Sulking

EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS - NIGHT #29#

Kristoff walks off the docks and sinks underwater.

.UNDERWATER #30#
even the fish and eels are paired up together.

KRISTOFF
~I'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE
~I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
~I'VE NEVER BEEN TOO WORLDLY IN THE WAYS OF WOMAN-WOOING

The water starts to freeze around Kristoff. But onces he sees a LARGE SWARM OF FISH in the shape of Anna, he breaks out of it.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I'M FREEZING UP, I'M BLOWING IT
~NOT WHAT I MEANT TO DO
~I KNOW HOW CRAZY LUCKY I AM TO LOVE YOU

Bubbles all around him hold reflections of Anna.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~GORGEOUS, FUNNY, BRAVE, AND BRILLIANT
~BEAUTIFUL, WON'T GIVE UP ON ANYONE
~YOU, OH!

EXT. ENDLESS SEA - CONTINUOUS #31#

Kristoff jumps out of the water and joins Anna on one of infinitely-stretching heart-shaped platforms across the ocean.

ANNA
Aww!

KRISTOFF
~I WANNA GET THIS RIGHT, BABY
~I WANNA LOVE YOU IN THE BEST WAY I CAN
~I WANNA MAKE YOU CRY
(spoken)
In a good way!
(sung)
~BY PROVING I COULD BE YOUR PERFECT MAN

EXT. NIGHT SKY - NIGHT #32#

Kristoff kneels on a huge star, but it tips over and he falls.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I MEANT TO WRITE IT IN THE SKY
~I MEANT TO GET DOWN ON ONE KNEE

He drifts past a star and sees his REFLECTION: a rugged, dirty ice harvester.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~I PLANNED TO REALLY TRY TO BE THE OPPOSITE OF ME

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, PATIO - CONTINUOUS #33#

Kristoff floats down and the magic fades away.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~BUT ANNA, I WILL LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY MIGHT
~**DOES IT MATTER THAT, IN HERE**
~I'VE GOT THAT PART RIGHT

Kristoff walks away, defeated.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
~WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THIS ON SOME OTHER NIGHT

### Anna's Proposal

Anna gets down on one knee and pulls out her own ring box, alongside Kristoff's one that he forgot.

ANNA
WAIT! Lord Kristoff of Arendelle, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

Kristoff is dumbstruck.

KRISTOFF
~YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!

They twirl under a spotlight.

Anna puts on the ring on Kristoff, and then vice versa.

BOTH
~BABY, I'M GONNA THRILL YOU IN THE WAY YOU DESERVE
~WE'RE GONNA GET THIS RIGHT, DARLING
~AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER, WE WON'T LOSE OUR NERVE

EXT. CHOCOLATE MOUNTAIN - DAY #34#

They stand on gigantic chocolates that stack up to the sky.

KRISTOFF
~I'M GONNA BE THE MAN YOU WANT

ANNA
~GUESS WHAT? YOU ALREADY ARE

EXT. SOME RIVER - DAY #35#

Kristoff rows Anna down a romantic river in a boat with huge chocolates. She slides down them to meet him.

KRISTOFF
~I WANNA MAKE YOUR LIFE SO GOOD

ANNA
~YOU'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD SO FAR

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, PATIO - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) #36#

The imagination fades back to reality. Yet they spin around and end up in an embrace.

But somehow, Kristoff's clothes have been MENDED -- he looks like a real prince.

BOTH
~WE GOT THE HARD PART OVER WITH
~NOW HOLD ME TIGHT
~WE'RE GONNA GET THIS RIGHT

They kiss.

Sven and Olaf peek and cheer on from a nearby window.

Without warning, Anna jumps and runs off.

ANNA
Oh! Elsa! ELSA!!!!

She stops. Turns back. Gives Kristoff the hardest full-on kiss. Runs off again.

KRISTOFF
(mumbling)
She's so happy to marry a loser like me.

Kristoff smiles, admiring his ring.

## 4 - Sleep

### Elsa Worries With Anna

INT. ARENDELLE PALACE, ELSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT #37#

Elsa sits on her bedside, facing her balcony doors, in silent, deep scrutiny of the Ahtohallan Map.

She wraps IDUNA's SCARF around herself.

ELSA
(whispering, tracing the map)
Arendelle... Northuldra... Ahtohal --

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

She jumps. She accidentally fires a blast of ICE towards her balcony, shrouding part of her balustrade in a cloud.

Still panting heavily, she tucks the map away in her bedside drawer, then cautiously walks towards it.

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, ELSA'S BEDROOM BALCONY - CONTINUOUS #38#

WATER DROPLETS on the spiky ice formation reflect the full moon's light. She closely studies it, then touches it and pulls back her hand -- it's wet.

Tips of of the structure break and fall off, amassing a pool of water on the floor. Elsa trembles worriedly, brows furrowed.

Without warning, her main bedroom doors thudded loudly.

ANNA
(impatient and progressively whale-like)
Elsa! ELsA! eLsAaaa!!

Elsa jumps in shock, and once again, fires another blast of ice which, this time, instead creates little snowmen creatures: Snowgies.

She forgets her fear and laughs at Anna's funny voice, and at the little Snowgies scuttling towards the door to see Anna.

INT. ARENDELLE PALACE, ELSA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS #39#

Elsa hesitates -- and sighs, closing the balcony door behind her, hiding the melting ice on the balcony.

ELSA
Come in!

Anna bursts the bedroom door open wide -- it was never locked; not anymore.

ANNA
(loudly)
Elsa!!

Anna shows off her new ring. Elsa runs and embraces her, the sisters giggling uncontrollably like madmen.

ELSA
[insert fourth wall joke about not getting a love interest, with subtext of previous worry]

They laugh some more, simmering in the joy, but Anna notices...

ANNA
You're wearing Mother's scarf... wait, is something wrong?

ELSA
There's this...

Elsa looks over her shoulder, towards the balcony doors.

ELSA
I just don't want to mess everything up. Again.

ANNA
You're scared about your powers again, aren't you?

### Anna's Lullaby

Anna pulls Elsa's face to meet her own.

ANNA
Your ice *creations* are just as amazing and beautiful as when we were children. Oh Elsa, when are you going to see yourself the way I see you?

ELSA
What would I do without you?

ANNA
You'll *always* have me.

Anna calls Elsa by the bedside, then sings the lullaby.


>~"All is Found (Reprise)"<

ANNA
~WHERE THE NORTH WIND MEETS THE SEA
~THERE'S A RIVER FULL OF MEMORY
~SLEEP MY DARLING SAFE AND SOUND
~Mm hmm hm hmmmm...

Elsa slowly loosens up her tensions, and slowly drifts off. Anna mumbles the last line, also falling asleep before she finishes the lullaby.

>BLACK FADE TO:

## 5 - Answer

### Elsa Confronts the Voice

INT. ARENDELLE PALACE, ELSA's BEDROOM - MUCH LATER #40#

Elsa stirs awake and turns around in bed, trying to ignore the

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

Her eyes open wide this time and she jerks upright, looking around irritated. She shuts her ears with her pillow.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

The pillow is pulled up. Elsa can't and won't sleep.

She sits up, looks over at Anna. Elsa wraps her in Iduna's scarf, then hesitantly slips out.

INT. ARENDELLE PALACE, HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS #41#

Elsa looks longingly at Anna, then quietly shuts the door behind her.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

Annoyed, Elsa SINGS to the air.


>~"Into the Unknown" (Unchanged)<

ELSA
~I CAN HEAR YOU BUT I WON'T
~SOME LOOK FOR TROUBLE
~WHILE OTHERS DON'T
~THERE'S A THOUSAND REASONS
~I SHOULD GO ABOUT MY DAY
~AND IGNORE YOUR WHISPERS
~WHICH I WISH WOULD GO AWAY

ELsa takes a walk, but the Voice keeps echoing.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~OH, OH, OH
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

ELSA
~YOU'RE NOT A VOICE
~YOU'RE JUST RINGING IN MY EAR
~AND IF I HEARD YOU, WHICH I DON'T
~I'M SPOKEN FOR I FEAR

She stands in front of two FAMILY PORTRAITS on the wall: the first of the sisters and the boys, and the second of the sisters with their parents.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~EVERYONE I'VE EVER LOVED IS HERE WITHIN THESE WALLS
~I'M SORRY, SECRET SIREN, BUT I'M BLOCKING OUT YOUR CALLS

Her hands start shaking. The magic wants to come out.

She starts walking towards the balcony, towards the Voice, but stops herself.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~I'VE HAD MY ADVENTURE, I DON'T NEED SOMETHING NEW
~I'M AFRAID OF WHAT I'M RISKING IF I FOLLOW YOU

### Elsa Lets Go

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, HALL BALCONY - CONTINUOUS #42#

Elsa succumbs and swings the balcony doors open wide. She sings to the fjord.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~INTO THE UNKNOWN
~INTO THE UNKNOWN
~INTO THE UNKNOWN

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

EXT. ARENDELLE COAST - NIGHT #43#

Elsa bursts through a door in the coast walls. She walks to the coastline and notes the faded water level lines on the walls.

ELSA
~WHAT DO YOU WANT?
~'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING ME AWAKE
~ARE YOU HERE TO DISTRACT ME
~SO I MAKE A BIG MISTAKE?

She looks at the Ahtohallan Map in her hand. And then in her reflection in the receded waters.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~OR ARE YOU SOMEONE OUT THERE
~WHO'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE ME?
~WHO KNOWS DEEP DOWN
~I'M NOT WHERE I'M MEANT TO BE?

Her hands start shaking again; but this time she lets them loose. It causes beautiful ice spirals that push her towards the waters.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~EVERY DAY'S A LITTLE HARDER
~AS I FEEL MY POWER GROW
~DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S PART OF ME
~THAT LONGS TO GO

She follows them, and is engulfed by an icy mist.

EXT. ELSA'S DREAMWORLD - CONTINUOUS #44#

Elsa steps into a black INFINITY ROOM, and marvels at the images of the Enchanted Forest coming to life around her in the form of NEON ICE PARTICLES.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~INTO THE UNKNOWN
~INTO THE UNKNOWN
~INTO THE UNKNOWN

A herd of reindeer run past her. A BOY is being chased by a GIRL, who is caught in the air by the River.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH AH, AH AH
~AH AH, AH AH

Elsa sends a bunch of ice bolts into the air.

ELSA
~OH, OH, OH
~ARE YOU OUT THERE?
~DO YOU KNOW ME?
~CAN YOU FEEL ME?
~CAN YOU SHOW ME?

The mist is all pulled towards Elsa, as they take the shape of:

1) A magical ICEBERG mass, and from it, a flowing RIVER that has tendrils for arms
2) A few magical horses –- the NOKKS -- running past...
3) ...which WRECK a SHIP from underneath in a DARK SEA
4) STONE GIANTS looming around
5) A FLOOD flowing down a gorge

ELSA AND MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH AH AH AH
~AH AH AH AH
~AH AH AH AH
~AH AH AH AH
~AH AH AH AH
~AH AH AH AH
~AH AH AH AH
~AH AH AH AH AH

EXT. ARENDELLE CLIFFS - CONTINUOUS #45#

The dreamworld fades, revealing a high mountainside. One last bright ICE BOLT swims around Elsa. It flies away upstream of the fjord.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
~DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE

Elsa follows it to the edge of a cliff, using her ice to reach out further -- but it EVAPORATES into the air.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~HOW DO I FOLLOW YOU
~INTO THE UNKNOWN

### Elsa Wakes the Forest

With a final cry, she lets loose a huge surge of magic -- causing a billion ICE CRYSTALS to form in the sky, suspended in the air, all throughout Arendelle.

ELSA
(spooked)
The Enchanted Forest is awake.

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE, ELSA'S BEDROOM, BALCONY - NIGHT #46#

The balcony doors open. Anna gazes around all the crystals and inhales shakily.

ANNA
E-Elsa?

EXT. ARENDELLE CLIFFS - NIGHT #47#

Elsa looks around, in wonder, but also in fear.

Without warning, the crystals all fall onto the ground with a dirty, deafening, clinking tumult.

INT. ARENDELLIAN'S HOUSE, CHILD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT #48#

A child is awoken by the noise. She covers her ears with a pillow, but the noise continues. She gets out of bed curiously.

EXT. ARENDELLE RESIDENTIAL STREETS - NIGHT #49#

One-by-one, families all pour out of their homes and onto the streets.

As the crystals shatter on the cobblestone, it releases a magical icy mist.

EXT. ARENDELLE CLIFFS - NIGHT #50#

Elsa looks over into the kingdom: windows glowed as people awoke.

ELSA
No... no... not again....

Elsa's hands start fidgeting. She involuntarily shoots an ice bolt into the waters.

IN THE WATERS

it causes a whirlpool to form and swell.

ELSA

fires again. And again.

IN THE WATERS

waves start to stir and collide.

ON THE DOCKS

we see the water level start to rise, even above where the faded water level mark used to be before.

ELSA

tries to control her hand. It has a mind of its own.

She finally gets a grip and stops. She pants heavily. She glances down --

CHAOTIC WAVES

beat against the cliff face, tickling her feet with mist spray.

Lightning strikes, illuminating in the water: the vague shape of a horse made of water -- the mythical NOKK.

OVER ARENDELLE

a combination of swirling hail, mist, snow, crystals and water starts to form.

ELSA

starts running in.

### Arendelle Evacuated

EXT. ARENDELLE PALACE COURTYARD - NIGHT #51#

Anna and a stream of castle staff pour out onto the court in a frenzy.

ANNA
(shouting)
Have you seen Elsa?

TWO LARGE FOUNTAINS

have their water pulled out from them, and the water evaporates into the air.

EXT. ARENDELLE WATERFALL - NIGHT #52#

The waterfall becomes stronger -- a great WIND turns it all into mist.

INT. SVEN'S SHED - NIGHT #53#

A large wind, shaped by autumn tree leaves, blows the doors wide open. The mist pushes Sven's bum outside.

EXT. ARENDELLE PLAZA - NIGHT #54#

Elsa arrives, seeking shelter in an alley behind a wall.

She sees trees falling and leaves flying everywhere. The strong winds push families down the road.

ELSA
The River wants us out.

A FAMILY

is running across the tumultuous plaza.

THE STATUE OF KING RUNEARD

is TIPPED over by the BLIZZARD, and starts to TILT precariously over the family.

THE FATHER

looks up. Emotions flash across his face, but he PULLS his family under him and SHIELDS them with his body.

He SHUTS his eyes, ready for the worst, until, in the nick of tim --

THE STATUE

is FROZEN, stuck in ice.

ELSA

stands afar off in the background, tired.

THE FATHER

lets out a huge cry of relief.

He hears a CRACKING sound. He looks up -- the statue tips again as the ice melts and cracks.

ELSA

frantically shoots out ice bolts, re-freezing bits of the statue in place.

But she grows WEAKER, and eventually no more ice comes out from her hands. There's NOTHING she can do.

The statue starts to tip again. The family try to run but the strong winds IMMOBILIZE them.

ELSA
NOOO!

The statue falls.

ANNA

appears and PUSHES the family out of the way to safety. But now she's under the statue.

ELSA

seeing this, regains her powers in the last second, completely ENCASING the statue in ice, so strongly that it tips over BACKWARDS, falls and shatters with a loud CRASH.

They share a panicked look.

ANNA
Elsa, are you okay?!

ELSA
Get everyone one out of here! The Voice says Arendelle is not safe!

Anna is perplexed, but she moves.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREETS - NIGHT #55#

It's chaotic: people fill the streets, tripping over as they are shoved out by the wind.

.INTERCUT: THE GANG RESCUES ARENDELLIANS #56#

Olaf runs through each house, finding a SCARED BOY hiding himself. He takes his hand.

Kristoff helps load many young children onto Sven's sleigh, now modified into a wagon.

Elsa tries to use her ice to shield the people from falling debris.

Anna consoles worried citizens.

ANNA
(to a mother)
It'll be okay!

OLAF
Hey, Anna...?

OLAF

is flurrying, fading away. He starts to melt, unable to stand by himself.

Even the frantic music quietens as Anna freezes, processing its implications... horror washing across her face...

OLAF
What's happening?

ANNA
(hushes)
Shhh, shhh!

ANNA

wraps him up in Iduna's scarf and loads him and the Scared Boy onto Sven.

EXT. ARENDELLE WALLS GATES - NIGHT #57#

Anna helps the last elderly citizen up and out of the main gates of Arendelle.

She dares one last look behind her shoulder: the flag of Arendelle held by the statue in the Plaza is torn by the wind and flies off.

A cloud of mist rises up from the plaza, the center of Arendelle, and then spreads out to form a large DOME of cloud around Arendelle.

The winds cause the gates to SLAM shut behind her.

## 6 - Recovery

### Arendelle Recovers

EXT. ARENDELLE CLIFFS, CLEARING - NIGHT #58#

In a wide, flat clearing, a population of about 2000 Arendellians gather in clusters around newly-lit campfires. The cliff side is dotted with rudimentary huts and simple stockpiles.

Kristoff attends to different citizens, handing out clothes; but he's especially visibly disheartened.

KRISTOFF
(mumbling)
Today was going so well...
(to citizen)
Yes, everyone's out and safe. Here, take one of these.
(to Olaf)
You okay there, Olaf?

Olaf is punctured with icicles by restless toddlers, looking like a voodoo doll.

OLAF
(gleefully)
Almost died, but couldn't be better! We're calling this, "controlling what you can when things feel out of control".

KRISTOFF
(sighs)
Oh yea, he's back to normal.

ANNA AND ELSA

conclude a gathering with elders and advisors and walk away to a private space.

ANNA
(whispering)
This isn't about Kristoff, right? Because the last time a guy propose --

ELSA
No! No, no! It's -- there's this Voice I've been hearing, and -- I just didn't want to worry you.

ANNA
We made a promise not to shut each other out!

ELSA
Okay.
(deep exhale)
I woke the Enchanted Forest.

ANNA
The dangerous Forest that Father warned us about as kids?

ELSA
That one.

ANNA
But why did you... cause all this?

ELSA
The Voice... it's making me lose control of my powers again.

Elsa pulls from under her cloak: the Ahtohallan Map. She hands it to Anna.

ELSA (CONT'D)
I found it a month ago. Father and Mother... they died sailing to this Ahtohallan place to find a cure for my powers.
(softens)
They died trying to cure me.

This hits Anna. They share a silent moment.

ELSA (CONT'D)
Ahtohallan is the source of my magic. The next right thing is to go through the Enchanted Forest and find Ahtohallan to reverse this curse.

ANNA
Is that what the "voice" is telling you?

ELSA
I know it sounds crazy, but I believe whoever is calling me is good.

ANNA
Look at our kingdom!

ARENDELLE

is covered in a thick, swirling cloud. Lightning flashes glow around dome, evidence of the roaring chaos within.

ANNA

is completely crestfallen.

ANNA
How... can you call this good?

Elsa twitches uncomfortably.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Arendelle is cursed -- again! And, I saw Olaf flurrying! What happened to permafrost?!

ELSA
My ice constructs are melting, Ann --

### Trolls Arrive

The ground starts rumbling. Everyone panics and takes cover.

ANNA
Oh no, what now?

EXCITED VOICES (O.S.)
Congratulations, Kristoff!

A barrage of rocks roll down the cliff hill, quaking the earth and causing people to fall over. They congregate at the feet of Kristoff.

They unroll and reveal bright, smiling faces. These are the TROLLS. A TROLL PRIEST amd BULDA steps forward from among them.

TROLL PRIEST
Do you, Kristoff, take Anna to be your trollfully wedded --

KRISTOFF
Ehm, now's not the best time...

BULDA
You can't keep secrets from me, Kristoff!

KRISTOFF
Bulda! I wanted it to be a surprise!

Kristoff is engulfed by a swarm of rocks.

One last troll makes his slow entrance, parting the crowd as he unrolls and approaches arthritic-ally. GRAND PABBIE nods respectfully to the sisters.

GRAND PABBIE
Your Majesty.
(warmly grinning)
You're a real piece of work.
(furrowed)
I came as soon as I heard.

ELSA
Grand Pabbie, can you tell me anything about what's going on?

Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Elsa's head. As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a silhouette of two shrouded peoples clashing.

GRAND PABBIE
(muttering)
The past will not stay in the past.

The people transform into a dam, with its final brick being laid upon it.

GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
A wrong demands to be righted.

The dam turns into a raging flood rushing down a gorge.

GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
Arendelle is not safe.

These imageries crystalize into snowflakes, dissipating in the air.

GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
The truth must be found: without it, I see no peace.

ANNA
No peace?

GRAND PABBIE
And when there is no peace, all one can do is the next right thing.

### The Gang Prepare to Leave

ELSA
The next right thing! I have to go through the Enchanted Forest.
(to Kristoff)
Kristoff, can I borrow your wagon, and Sven?

KRISTOFF
Have you ever driven a reindeer?

Elsa purses her lips. Kristoff and Sven puff.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Hmmph. Thought so.

ANNA
(to Elsa)
You're not doing this alone.

ELSA
Anna, no. I have my powers to protect me, you don't.

ANNA
You don't have to protect me, I'm not afraid!

FLASH CUT TO:

FLASHBACK: Young Anna is struck by Elsa's powers.

ELSA
Anna!

Young Anna falls unconscious. Young Elsa races to her.

FLASH CUT TO:

THE PRESENT: Elsa's face sinks in pain.

ELSA
Anna... **I'm** afraid.

ANNA
(softens)
Elsa, I climbed to the North Mountain, survived a frozen heart, and saved you from my ex-boyfriend, and I did it all without powers, so, you kno --
(lightheartedly)
--maybe I'll be the one protecting you!

Elsa ruminates deeply... a twinge of guilt flashes across her face... then nods agreeably in defeat.

KRISTOFF
Cool, and I'm driving.

OLAF
I'll bring the snacks! Wait, I left them in the castle...

They get busy packing, and Elsa turns around to address the whole nation listening and watching in silence.

ELSA
I leave Kai, my personal assistant, in charge while we are gone.

Kai is nonplussed, but then blushes at the attention.

ELSA
Come on, you've basically been running Arendelle for the past six years. Here...

Elsa goes off to engage with Kai and the council of elders and advisors. Anna follows too, but her hand gets pulled back.

Grand Pabbie hunches over, motioning her to come close.

GRAND PABBIE
(whispering)
I sense… an immense change for Elsa on the horizon. And that will cause an immense change for you.

ANNA
But some things never change... right?

GRAND PABBIE
Fear will be your enemy.
(sighs)
Take care of her, Anna.

ANNA
I won't let anything happen to her.

FADE TO:


# ACT 2A


## 7 - Door

### Olaf's Travel Montage

/* EXT. ARENDELLIAN CLIFF - DAWN
The gang begin their journey, taking one last look at their people as they pull away from their impromptu campsite.

KRISTOFF
That should be everything. All set?

ANNA
Hey, didn't Father say that the Forest is covered in the same wall of mist... like Arendelle?

ELSA
The Voice is telling me to go there. There'll be a way. */

EXT. WILDERNESS - DAWN (MONTAGE: TRAVELING) #59#

The gang travel across different sceneries as the sun rises and as they make their journey up North: a narrow path against the cliff, a large plains, a bridge over a chasm, a dry wilderness.

Throughout the journey, Olaf is chirpy and seemingly oblivious. The other three share worried faces, but are mostly keeping to themselves. Kristoff is nose buried into his poem book.

OLAF
Hey, who wants trivia? I do! Did you know that water has memory? True fact, it's disputed by many, but it' --

CUT TO:

OLAF (CONT'D)
Did you know men are six more times more likely to be struck by lightning?

OLAF (CONT'D)
Did you know that some Living Rock species can so large that they are mistaken for mountains?

OLAF (CONT'D)
Did you know tha --

KRISTOFF
Did you know that sleeping quietly on long journeys prevents insanity?

OLAF
(laughing)
Yeah, that's not true.

KRISTOFF
It is.

ELSA
It is definitely true.

ANNA ^
It's the truth.

OLAF
Hmm, well, that was unanimous. But I will look it up when we get home.

CUT TO:

### Kristoff Wooing #1

EXT. GRASS FIELD - DAY #60#

The sun shines bright on a pleasant grass field. Most of the morning has passed, and Sven has slowed down his pace.

Anna turns around to find Elsa and Olaf both sleeping from exhaustion.

ANNA
They're both asleep.
(playful)
So, my fiancé... what do you wanna do?

Kristoff jerks upwards and snaps his poem book shut suspiciously.

KRISTOFF
Sven, keep us steady, will you?

Sven turns around, nodding his head, but secretly grimacing to brace what comes next.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Anna.
(voice cracking)
Ahem.
(deep breath)
Roses are red. Crocus are blue.
(confidently)
My love for me will be... no...
(stammering)
Your love for me... the sea...

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

From behind the sleigh, Elsa sleepily opens an eye.

KRISTOFF
(thinking)
Just when everything seemed to be going perfect, something wrong just has to happen.

ANNA
(whistles)
Tell me about it.

Kristoff holds up his ring finger.

KRISTOFF
(slumped)
I thought this meant that, I would never get it wrong anymore.

ANNA
Hey. I love your poem. I love you.

Kristoff can't help smiling, but still has furrowed brows and can't bring himself to meet eye contact.

### Elsa and the Wall of Mist

Elsa is wide awake now, and taking opportunity of the silence, yawns and feigns waking up.

ELSA
Good morning -- wait. I hear the Voice. We're here.

ANNA
You do? Olaf, wake up.

Kristoff motions Sven to stop. The gang comes down from the wagon and follows Elsa over a small hill.

EXT. NORTHULDRA, WALL OF MIST - CONTINUOUS #61#

At the top, we see a huge cloud of mist, spanning from left to right, top to bottom, as far as the eye can see.

Without warning, Elsa takes off in large strides towards the mist.

ANNA
Elsa!

Elsa runs into the mist, but gets rebounded as if colliding with a magical force-field. She crumples onto the ground a few feet away.

ANNA
(gasp)
Elsa!

Anna sprints towards Elsa to picks her up. Elsa pushes away her hand -- she's fine, just dizzy.

Olaf, seeing this, excitedly runs at the wall and gets rebounded. He repeats this -- for fun.

ANNA
Are you okay?

ELSA
Yes... but the mist... the voice... it brought me so far just to stop me here?

Seeing Elsa's demeanor just breaks Anna's heart. She gives a cheerful smile.

ANNA
Come on, maybe it takes three times, or something.

Anna grasps Elsa's hand and pulls her upright, holds it tight.

ANNA
Promise me we do this together, okay?

Elsa weakly nods. They walk together towards the mist... and this time, the wall of mist parts in two.

ELSA
Into the unknown?

ANNA
Together.

Behind them, Olaf awkwardly reaches for Kristoff's hand. Kristoff awkwardly takes it.

They all step in and the mist closes up behind them.

## 8 - Forest

### Trapped Inside

INT. NORTHULDRA, WALL OF MIST, INSIDE - CONTINUOUS #62#

The dense cloud prevents vision further than an arm's reach. The gang hold onto each other and blindly press on forward.

OLAF
Did you know that the Enchanted Forest is a place of transformation? I have no idea what that means, but I can't wait to see what it's gonna do to each one of us.

They all look at each other nervously.

Without warning, a great gust of mist pushes them forward.

### The Enchanted Forest

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST, FOREST EDGE - CONTINUOUS #63#

The gang are roughly ejected from the cloud onto autumnal foliage.

ANNA
Hey!

Kristoff tries to barge his way back into the mist: he gets rebounded away. Olaf childishly continues his game.

Elsa shoots ice spikes into the mist. They pierce the mist... and then are reflected back. Everyone dives out of the way.

KRISTOFF
AHHH!

ANNA
(trails off)
We're locked in. I guess we...

As they turn way from the mist, they slowly marvel at the Forest before them: a forest like no other, enchanted with strange hybrids of otherworldly creatures.

The trees seem to sway by their own, while the environment itself seemed to be alive in more ways than one.

ELSA
Whoa.

ANNA
This is beautiful.

Kristoff nods dumbly. Everyone is just in awe -- they stagger and drunkenly explore the forest.

### The Dam Mess

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST, CLIFF CLEARING - DAY #64#

Anna, Kristoff and Sven wander out of the forest line, coming to a small clearing at the edge of a cliff.

They get a magnificent view of a steep cliff face that runs in a miles-wide arc around a bowl.

In the middle of that arc, towers a mighty brick dam that plugs a U-shaped hole in the cliff face. Below it, a parched riverbed snakes downwards and through the wall of mist.

Anna and Kristoff gawk wide-jawed at the scenery, more so at the dam.

ANNA
(muttering)
That's a big gift of peace.

KRISTOFF
Yea... imagine all the water it's holding back...

ANNA
What?

KRISTOFF
The dam stretches downwards so deep, yet it's overflowing to the brim. I'm saying, your grandfather created an architectural masterpiece to be able to withstand that much pressure! Because if it break --

ANNA
(panicky)
*If* it breaks?!

KRISTOFF
(oblivious)
If that dam breaks, it would send a tidal wave so big, it would wash away everything on this fjord.

ANNA
Everything... but Arendelle is on this fjord.

KRISTOFF
Yep.

ANNA
But our home! And our people! Everything we've built, everything we've done, everything would be lost! So what do we do?

KRISTOFF^
(realizes)
No, no! Anna! It'll be fine! The dam stood for who-knows-how-long, I'm sure it'll still stand!

ANNA (CONT'D)
Is there anything we can even do? But what if the River just continues to rise?

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)^
We could make the dam stronger! Build it higher! Don't panic, here, I wrote this song:

Kristoff whips out his lute from a worried Sven.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
(sings)
~Na, na, nanananana,
~Anna, there's no one better

ANNA
Wait.
(whips head around)
Where's Elsa?

Anna takes off into the forest, cutting Kristoff's song short. Kristoff sulks, unsure of what to do.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Come on, Kristoff!

Kristoff's eyes lighten up, a little bit. He rubs his engagement ring, squares his shoulders, and mounts Sven to pursue Anna.

## 9 - Olaf

### Olaf Trusts In Maturity

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST, FOGGY CLEARING - DAY #65#

CLOSE ON: OLAF.

OLAF
Yea, come on, Kristoff!

Olaf turns around, revealing: his surroundings are gray and foggy, like cobwebs in a spider's den. He's LOST.

OLAF
Umm, Anna? Elsa? Sven? Samantha?
(laughs)
I don't even know who's Samantha!

He hears a distant STAMPEDE approaching, but he turns around blindly, unsure of its direction. It gets louder. He gets nervous.

From THE STAMPEDE'S POV, as we veer we see Olaf straight ahead, faced away. We speed up furiously towards him.

OLAF

spins around just in time to see a brownish-grey streak running through him, knocking him into pieces like bowling pins.

The Stampede's cacophony of laughter eerily fades away, leaving Olaf face-down in a hole the ground.

FROM THE HOLE

Olaf's face covers the hole. A pause.

OLAF
(gasps)
Samantha?

OLAF

picks the pieces of himself back up. He wrestles with some thought, then pushes it away with a skip, a smile and a song.


>~"When I'm Older" (Shortened)<

OLAF
~THIS WILL ALL MAKE SENSE WHEN I AM OLDER
~LIKE WHY WE'RE IN THIS DARK ENCHANTED WOOD

A distant, deep and rumbling roar echoes throughout the Forest. The ground shakes a little, causing Olaf to lose footing and his cheeriness.

OLAF (CONT'D)
~I KNOW IN A COUPLE OF YEARS,
~THESE WILL SEEM LIKE CHILDISH FEARS

Then comes a faint whistling sound, growing louder, and a shadow grows bigger under Olaf's feet.

OLAF (CONT'D)
~AND SO I KNOW THIS ISN'T BAD,
~IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD

Olaf obliviously walks out of the shadow just in time for a giant boulder to land right behind him with a BOOM. It sends debris flying into the air.

Olaf freezes in shock, and slowly turns around. That's a giant boulder that nearly killed him.

OLAF
(surprised)
That's normal!

He turns back around, with the forgetful glee of a child. Another boulder rolls past downhill, narrowly missing him.

OLAF (CONT'D)
~GROWING UP MEANS ADAPTING,
~PUZZLING AT YOUR WORLD AND YOUR PLACE

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST, POND - DAY #66#

Olaf walks to the pond's edge and admires his "muscles" and himself in the reflection... which darkly morphs into the shape of an angry Nokk.

OLAF (CONT'D)
~WHEN I'M MORE MATURE,
~I'LL FEEL TOTALLY SECURE,
~BEING WATCHED BY SOMETHING WITH A CREEPY, CREEPY FACE...

The Nokk lunges out of the water at Olaf, startling him to start running for his life.

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST, FOGGY CLEARING #67#

FROM OLAF's THIRD PERSON REVERSE POV it's all chaos: he's all arms flailing. The Nokk is hunting him down with a ghastly cry, sending punches of water. The Stampede's streak causes leaves to swirl about in the air. Large rocks fall all around him.

OLAF
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Olaf is launched by a rock and falls in pieces into a hole.

ZOOMING OUT FROM THE HOLE reveals that it is in fact, a GIANT FOOTPRINT.

Olaf's head pops up cheerily, and his body parts slowly reconstruct themselves.

OLAF (CONT'D)
~SEE, THAT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE WHEN I'M OLDER,
~SO THERE'S NO NEED TO BE TERRIFIED OR TENSE

Olaf pulls himself up from the footprint hole.

OLAF (CONT'D)
~I'LL JUST DREAM ABOUT A TIME,
~WHEN I'M IN MY AGE OF PRIME
~'CAUSE WHEN YOU'RE OLDER,

The chaos begins to resume all around Olaf: water geysers, leaves thrown around, meteor boulders.

OLAF (CONT'D)
~ABSOLUTELY, EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE!
(spoken)
This is fine.

Olaf flees, being chased by the magical creatures.

## 10 - Encounter

### The Ambush

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST, DENSE FOREST - DAY #68#

Elsa walks into the middle of a CLEARING amidst a DENSE FOREST, with a waning focus of the Mysterious Voice.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
(fading)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

OLAF (O.S.)
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Olaf leaps out from a branch and into Elsa's arms, shivering from fright. It breaks Elsa's concentration and she loses the voice.

ELSA
Olaf!

Anna pushes through the bushes, Kristoff and Sven hot behind her. She breathes a sigh of relief.

ANNA
Elsa! Olaf! We have to stick together! -- What if we lose each other?!

A RUSTLING SOUND rattles behind them. And then above. And then all around.

OLAF
It's the magical creatures!

KRISTOFF
Guys...?

The gang stand back-to-back, ready for a confrontation.

TWO GROUPS OF ARMED PEOPLE burst through the shrubbery on opposite sides, sandwiching the gang in the clearing: about 15 UNIFORMED SOLDIERS and 25 AGRARIAN WARRIORS.

THE UNIFORMED SOLDIERS

wielded SWORDS AND SPEARS, besides their standard-bearer -- while

THE AGRARIAN WARRIORS

perched around in the trees, wearing ANIMAL SKINS and using simple PITCHFORKS.

Both groups were ready to shed blood.
/* They assumed an aggressive formation and violent war cry, fanning out and closing in on the gang in the process. */
ELSA

starts panicking. She reflexively freezes the entire floor around her, knocking everyone over and pushing them backwards to the edge of the clearing.

Silence. Shock. Fear. Disbelief. Awe. Mixed emotions from both sides.

If they hadn't fallen over, it was because their lower legs were completely encased in ice. The UNIFORMED LEADER, middle-aged and handsome, was particularly angry and on edge.

UNIFORMED LEADER
(cold)
Magic.

UNIFORMED DEPUTY ^
(shock)
Magic!

AGRARIAN LEADER
(awe)
Magic!

Elsa sorrily unfreezes the floor -- even though the ice was weak enough for the Uniformed Leader to hack the ice off himself.

OLAF
(waving)
Hi, my name is Olaf, and I --

AGRARIAN WARRIORS
(scared, pointing)
AHHHH!

An animated, talking snowman. The uniformed soldiers fall back to formation, trembling this time. The agrarian warriors follow suit.

ELSA
Please, don't be afraid --

Too late for that. Some of them were backing out, pushing others in front.

### Identifying the Arendellians

Anna notices the ARENDELLIAN INSIGNIA on the standard banner and the uniforms of the UNIFORMED SOLDIERS -- they were ARENDELLIAN SOLDIERS.

ANNA
I am Princess Anna of Arendelle!

Both sides stopped in their tracks.

ANNA (CONT'D)
(gesturing to Elsa)
This is my sister... *Queen* Elsa of Arendelle.

Both sides murmur. A ruler of Arendelle with magic powers?

The AGRARIAN LEADER, a *middle-aged* woman with fierce but perceptive eyes, steps up.

AGRARIAN LEADER
Funny how the Voice of Ahtohallan leads you here. My name is Yelena. I am the chieftess of the Northuldra.

Elsa is hooked. She stares at YELENA, gears grinding.

Anna steps towards the other side, towards the ARENDELLIAN DEPUTY, who was rigid yet curious.

ANNA
(to Arendellian Deputy)
I've seen you somewhere before.
(pause)
That's it! Lieutenant Mattias, the king's guard!

MATTIAS is taken aback -- everyone was.

MATTHIAS
How did --

ANNA (CONT'D)
(framing him with fingers)
More serious in person than in portrait! Father always mentioned how you had a quirk for reindeer.

The Arendellian Leader and Deputy turn to each other, flummoxed -- but then the realization and implications washes across both their faces.

ELSA
(to Arendellian Leader)
But that must mean... Grandpa! You're alive!

The sisters run to hug their grandfather, RUNEARD. He flinched at Elsa's icy touch -- that, and at being called "grandfather" at 40-years-old by these two random women.

RUNEARD
(realization)
My Prince Agnarr escaped the mist.
(pause)
It's been 34 years...
(to the sisters, almost sneering)
Tell me, how is my kingdom in the hands of a magical person?

Elsa shifts uncomfortably; and Anna was oblivious.

ANNA
Grandpa, you were the greatest king of Arendelle! Since your reign, our docks were always filled with trading ships! We've never been attacked by other nations --
(Elsa turns away)
–- the people are safe and happy!

Runeard huffs in pride.

ELSA
(quickly)
Serving Arendelle as Queen was easy, from the legacy that Father and you had left behind.

This thrills his ears... but...

RUNEARD
(realizes)
Shouldn't my son, Agnarr, still be king? Wow... my son -- older than me? I --

ELSA
Our parents... died in a shipwreck. Trying to find answers for my magic powers.

Runeard loses it with every word. He turns to Yelena, sword drawn, soldiers behind him at the ready.

RUNEARD
That day you attacked my people! For 34 years *you* try to break *my* dam! Now, your magic has me relive my son's death again!
(shouts)
Magic must be controlled!

Everyone draws their own weapons again -- the Arendellians rallied by Runeard's speech, and the Northuldra in survival self-defense.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
(to the gang? To Anna?)
Get behind me. Keep your guard up.

### National Justice

A nasty brawl would have taken place, if not for Anna throwing herself in between the two clans, hands outstretched, squeezing her eyes hoping that it'd work.

Elsa and the gang stepped in and supported her as both sides came to a halt again.

ANNA
(to Runeard)
Grandpa! You're just shocked! And -- and heartbroken. Our parents passed six years ago, and
(to Elsa)
we've put our pain in the past, right?

Elsa nods... hesitantly. But the people are still at each other's throats.

An idea slowly forms in Elsa's mind. She squares her shoulders.

ELSA
As the current Queen of Arendelle, I call for a truce.

Both sides look at her as if she's mad.

ELSA
(at Anna)
We --
(to everyone)
will seek the truth and make peace between the two nations.

RUNEARD
(softening)
What peace is there for my son?
I want justice.

YELENA
So do I. I lost my husband the day the Forest attacked --

RUNEARD
When **you** caused the forest to attack!

YELENA
(to Elsa, ignoring Runeard)
I had to become chieftess overnight.
(pause)
But that day, I was foretold that **an Arendellian royal who was one with magic would break the curse and free the Forest.**

The soldiers tense and murmur among themselves.

RUNEARD
You're saying you want Queen Elsa to use her magic to break my dam, flood my nation and wipe out my people?

Aggression rises again. But with every accusation, the soldiers get more and more agitated. The situation must be completely defused, now.

### Making a Truce

ANNA
(cutting in)
Arendelle is covered in a wall of mist too!

Silence fell. It was a solemn revelation for both sides, because they knew full well what that meant.

ANNA (CONT'D)
That's why we came! To free Arendelle. Everyone was evacuated in time.
(glancing to Runeard)
No one was hurt.

Runeard sheathes back his sword, but Elsa realizes that she has to separate the clans to end this for good.

ELSA
Olaf and I will talk with the Northuldra, while Anna and Kristoff will talk with the Arendellians.

This seemed to be agreeable with all parties, but Anna.

ELSA (CONT'D)
I promise there will be no breaking of dams. My nation will not be flooded. Especially not by her Queen.
(sighs)
I want peace.

Yelena smiles. Runeard steps back warily, still unsatisfied.

MATTHIAS
(to Runeard)
Is this safe?

RUNEARD
I am tired of fighting.
(to Anna, softly)
I would like to catch up on Prince Agnarr's life.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
(to Mattias and soldiers)
We return to camp at the dam.

ARENDELLIAN SOLDIERS
(bark)
Keep your guard up!

The Arendellians start to march off, and the Northuldra follow suit, but both sides still eye each other.

ANNA
(to Elsa)
Why do we have to separate? Why can't Kristoff go with Olaf?

PAN TO:

.OFF IN THE BACKGROUND #69#

Kristoff and Olaf introduce themselves to some Arendellian soldiers.

OLAF
(extending hand)
Hi! I'm Olaf!

KRISTOFF
(gesturing)
See! There's nothing to be afraid of!

One soldier cautiously takes Olaf's hand, but it falls off.

ARENDELLIAN SOLDIERS
(screams)
AHHHH!!!

KRISTOFF
No, no, don't worry --

As Kristoff tries to fix Olaf's hand back, he elbows Olaf's head clean off.

It falls to the ground with a thump. And a shriek.

OLAF
(jokingly)
AHHHH!!! My head!!!

ARENDELLIAN SOLDIERS
(screams) (again)
AHHHH!!!

The soldiers flee into the bushes, leaving the boys alone.

OLAF'S DECAPITATED HEAD
(bashful, looking up at Kristoff)
Was that joke too far?

KRISTOFF
(scratches neck)
I thought it was fine.

PAN BACK TO:

.THE SISTERS #70#

Anna relents. Sighs. Boys.

ANNA
Alright. But we meet at dusk.

DISSOLVE TO:

## 11 - Campfire

### Elsa's Secrets

= I thought it more fit for the Northuldra to have 80ish villagers, and 25ish Arendellian soldiers.

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST - DAY #71#

They separate into their respective campsites that are along the same bank of the river: the Arendellians' camp is up against the dam, and the Northuldra's camp about 350 meters upstream.

EXT. NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE, TEEPEES - DAY #72#

The NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE is AGRARIAN, marked with leather teepees and wooden fences. Otherworldly Forest animals like cow-zebra hybrids are being milked by adults, accompanied by wolf-cat pets.

Olaf has a teepee as a backdrop, and is performing a one-man reenactment of the events of Frozen I.

OLAF
(dramatically)
It began with two sisters. One born with magical powers, and one born powerless. Their love of snowmen, infinite.

CUT TO:

OLAF (AS YOUNG ELSA) (CONT'D)
"Anna, No! Too high!" **Blast!**

The NORTHULDRA CHILDREN (who we learn to be Olaf's audience) are only half-attentive, picking at Olaf's magical body, while one of them just stuffed Olaf's leg down another child's mouth.

OLAF (AS YOUNG ELSA) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
(lost in the drama)
"Ow, Mama, Papa, help!"

EXT. NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE, CAMPFIRE - DAY #73#

Elsa and Yelena are talking while cooking fish around a campfire, and Yelena suddenly puts down her knitting needles.

YELENA
*Wait*. After you accidentally struck Anna in the head when you were children, King Agnarr went to the trolls?

ELSA
Yes... why?

YELENA
(scoffing)
A King of Arendelle, seeking help from magic? He must've been desperate.

Elsa shifts uncomfortably. Yelena senses this, and acted casual, resuming her knitting.

YELENA (CONT'D)
So, Grand Pabbie removed Anna's memory of magic?

ELSA
Yes, he told me that I must learn to control it, that's why I'm here --

YELENA
Fair enough, but what *does* she know now?

ELSA
Anna only remembers we were playing in winter. I don't know if she truly remembers what happened -- the white streak in her hair from the incident has faded... but it's still there, underneath.

YELENA
(chillingly)
Secrets are more dangerous than magic can ever be.

### Anna's Naiveté

EXT. NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE, TEEPEES - DAY #74#

Olaf continues his reenactment.

OLAF
(continuing)
**Slam!** Doors shutting everywhere, sisters torn apart! Well, at least they have their parents.

CUT TO:

OLAF (CONT'D)
Their parents are dead.

The Northuldra children are mortified, open-jawed in whiplash response.

CUT TO:

OLAF (AS ANNA) (CONT'D)
(singing)
~I WANT TO STUFF SOME CHOCOLATE IN MY FACEEEE!

OLAF (CONT'D)
(pauses)
Wait -- this is not chocolate.

CUT TO:

OLAF (AS ANNA) (CONT'D)
Oh, I am Anna, I wanna marry a man I just met!"

EXT. ARENDELLIAN CAMPSITE - DAY #75#

The ARENDELLIAN CAMPSITE is built like a fortress: it had wooden-spiked walls and outpost towers on the perimeter all around. Soldiers patrol their stations and chase out wild animals. There is no trace of Forest life.

Runeard and Anna are also roasting food over a campfire, some unknown meat, and Runeard also suddenly pauses.

RUNEARD
*Wait*. You wanted to marry a stranger you just met?

Anna shrugs sheepishly.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
If only Prince -- ahem. If only King Agnarr was around to chastise you.
(solemn)
It's... realizing that you have outlived your child... twice...
(waves it off)
Anyways -- that's very foolish, my dear.

ANNA
Yeah, who would've known Hans wanted to take over the throne!

Runeard raises a curious eyebrow. Anna catches on.

ANNA
Of course, since then, I've grown up. With Kristoff --

Anna points to Kristoff in the distance by the campsite outskirts, who is deep in conversation with Mattias.

ANNA (CONT'D)
-- well, it's been a while now. He just proposed --

Runeard's eyes flicker to her ring finger. He is properly impressed.

RUNEARD
Congratulations, darling.

ANNA
(grins)
Thanks! And I think we're going to enjoy this phase a little longer before we get married.

Runeard takes Anna's hand, which surprises her at first. But Runeard just beams a warm, parental smile.

RUNEARD
I like him. He's a strong, honest man. A non-royal is a breath of fresh air: he's not entitled with position, or power. Just like your mother, you say?

Anna nods attentively.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
I wish I had known that when I was your age. But I have raised a wise son, and he raised a wise daughter. Kristoff will work very hard to be your husband and to never hurt you. He is perfect... so unlike that Prince Hans of yours. And, your sister, Queen Elsa.

Anna tenses. She quickly studies her grandfather: Runeard is suddenly more wrinkled, more tired, more fierce.

ANNA
(defensive)
Hans is a monster, unlike Elsa. She's my sister and she loves me very much!

Surprisingly... Runeard was calm? He studies Anna this time, as a shepherd does to a weak, crippled lamb.

RUNEARD
I see that that is very true. But from what you have told me so far: who has caused you more grief and pain? This Hans fellow who you've known for a day... or your sister who's been with you -- or hasn't been with you -- your whole life?

Anna pulls her whole body back in disgust. She's forming words, but holding her tongue.

RUNEARD
(growls)
Keep your guard up.

### Mattias' Caution

EXT. NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE, TEEPEES - DAY #76#

Olaf continues his reenactment, morphing his body to look like each character, besides also somehow wearing their costume from Frozen 1.

OLAF (AS ELSA)
Magic pulses through my snowflakes.

CUT TO:

OLAF (CONT'D)
(imitating Frankenstein's monster)
I live!

CUT TO:

OLAF (AS ELSA)
(singing)
~HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY
~LET THE STORM RAGE --
(preparing to belt)

CUT TO:

OLAF (AS ELSA) (CONT'D)
Get out Anna! Pew pew!

OLAF (AS ANNA) (CONT'D)
My heart!

CUT TO:

OLAF (AS GRAND PABBIE) (CONT'D)
Only an act of true love can save you.

CUT TO:

OLAF (AS HANS) (CONT'D)
Here's a true love's kiss... You're not worth it. Guess what? I'm the bad guy!

Suddenly, Olaf gets pelted by a barrage of sticks and rocks: the Northuldra children were showing their distaste of Hans.

CUT TO:

OLAF (CONT'D)
(solemnly)
And Anna freezes to death... forever.
(in a single breath)
Then she unfreezes. Oh, and then Elsa woke up the magical spirits, and we were forced out from our kingdom. Now our only hope is to find the truth about the past, but we don't have a clue how to do that. Except Elsa's hearing voices, so we got that going for us. Any questions?

The Northuldra children have lost all attention, now even worse: one kid starts crying; another kid is sticking Olaf's arm in another kid's nose, and such.

OLAF
(pleased, to himself)
I think they got it.

EXT. ARENDELLIAN CAMPSITE, OUTSKIRTS - DAY #77#

Many wild reindeer hide in the fringes of the trees, just out of sight of the soldiers. Sven is having a field day just frolicking through the trees.

Kristoff and Matthias are in deep focus as well.

KRISTOFF
*Wait*. You speak for them too?

Mattias squirmed. Then weighed his options.

MATTIAS
(sighs)
Don't tell my soldiers.
(craning around)
I guess it's fine if only you know...

Mattias walks up to a WILD REINDEER hidden in some bushes. It looks just like Sven... but its eyes are sharper. Alert. Suspicious.

MATTIAS (AS WILD REINDEER)
(throwing out his voice)
I'm hungry!

MATTIAS (CONT'D)
I've fed you yesterday!

MATTIAS (AS WILD REINDEER) (CONT'D)
But not today!

The reindeer let out an annoyed growl.

MATTIAS
Well, fair enough. (CONT'D)

Mattias tosses a carrot, which the wild reindeer snaps up and then runs away with. Mattias turns back around, shrugging amusedly.

BOTH
It's like you can hear their thoughts.

Kristoff huffs in pleasant surprise, though Mattias obviously has a long way to go. Kristoff leans against a tree, fully relaxed now.

KRISTOFF
I thought the king's guard has to be all --
(mock-serious voice)
-- cautious and vigilant, careful for danger lurking at every corner!

Mattias narrows his eyes.

MATTIAS
I *am* cautious and vigilant.

Kristoff winces and gives a sheepish shrug. Mattias paces around, as if talking to himself.

MATTIAS
King Runeard always tells us,
(as Runeard)
"Magic is dangerous! It's the reason why we've been trapped in here! We are never safe!"
(sighs)
"Stop playing around with reindeer, Lieutenant! You are my personal bodyguard! Keep your guard up!"

Mattias sits on a large rock, and slouches in defeat.

MATTIAS (CONT'D)
I'm in unknown territory.
(loathsomely)
He's right: the world *is* dangerous. If only you had seen what happened the day the Northuldra betrayed us.

### The Battle of Northuldra

EXT. NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE, CAMPFIRE - DAY #78#

Elsa and Yelena are halfway through their meal. The sky has lost some of its brightness.

ELSA
Father said that the Northuldra caused the attack that day.

Yelena snorted, rolling her eyes... then stops chewing the fish, and swallows it whole. She furrows.

YELENA
(straining)
Everything was *fine* until the official ceremony when King Runeard placed the final brick down on the dam. Then everything happened so fast...
(shivers)
Everyone started fighting... but the Forest claimed more lives than the sword... Tosawi and many others were gone.

EXT. ARENDELLIAN CAMPSITE - DAY #79#

Anna and Runeard put aside their dinner. The sky has gotten darker and the campfire now casts a hot glow on Runeard's features.

RUNEARD
(struggling)
I lost my son... I saw him... get washed away... of course, he lived... just to be washed away again...

A lone tear breaks free from Runeard's eye. He wipes it clean.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
That's what I get for wanting to make peace.

Anna's shoulders drop her defenses, but she's still trying to figure out this man.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. We never had occasion to talk about that day -- neither do we want to.

### Destroying the Dam

EXT. NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE, CAMPFIRE - DAY #80#

Elsa and Yelena continue, but Elsa puts aside her fish and her hunger, leaning in instead.

YELENA
It's simple. Even King Runeard knows it: the mist came up when the dam came up. To bring down the curse, we have been trying to bring down the dam. We just want to be free --

ELSA
(tense)
You would wash away my people.

YELENA
(laughs)
Of course not, my bitsóóké. I have a people too. I had to become chieftess overnight.

Elsa softens, and nods in familiar understanding.

YELENA
We wouldn't use the earth giants --

Elsa tilts her head. Yelena waves her off.

YELENA (CONT'D)
They would bring the whole dam down at once, flooding your people. The giants rarely come out anymore, let alone us trying to control them.

YELENA (CONT'D)
So we wanted to chip the dam bit by bit so Arendelle knows to flee the land before we break it for good. But King Runeard, he said --

EXT. ARENDELLIAN CAMPSITE - DAY #81#

Runeard shoots upright indignantly.

RUNEARD
Destroy my gift? And flood my nation? That I built with blood, sweat and tears? Should my people's homes be destroyed, and go back to live in dirt huts?

ANNA
The dam can't fall, Grandpa. Even now that everyone's evacuated.

RUNEARD
The dam is holding back more water now than ever before, Princess Anna. I fear it may not just wash away our good land, but our good people on the cliffside as well!

Runeard looks up at the sky longingly.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
I, too, want to see the sky and return to my beautiful home. It's been 34 long years. I still don't know what to do. But when life throws you on a new path, you mustn't give up. Take one step at a time.

ANNA
And do the next right thing?

RUNEARD
(nods)
Magic has separated us from our family. Magic has made me experience my son's death twice. Magic now threatens to separate my people from their home. Princess Anna.... magic has to be controlled. You don't want to hear this, but I think the voice that Queen Elsa is hearing... it wants her to destroy the dam. You must control your sister.

### Controlling Magic

EXT. NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE, CAMPFIRE - DUSK #82#

Yelena pokes at a campfire that's on its final breaths with the back of her needle.

ELSA
I'm losing control of my magic. Please tell me: the Northuldra can control magic.

YELENA
We can... ask for the River to fill our cups with water.

Yelena demonstrates by holding out a cup, and a tendril of water rises up out of the river and fills her cup before retreating back. Elsa is awed.

YELENA (CONT'D)
But that's about it. The River does what it wants; we only listen, and follow.

ELSA
What was the prophecy you talked about back there? And about the voice?

YELENA
Some say they heard the voice of Ahtohallan call out the day the Forest attacked. But I heard it most clearly. It sounded like Chief Tosawi's voice, but he... he was already gone.

Yelena waves away the thought.

YELENA
Anyways -- the voice. It spoke to me. It said... "**An Arendellian royal who is one with magic and snow, will lift the curse and let my people go.**"

ELSA
(scrunches)
I -- I won't flood my own nation.

YELENA
I'm not asking you to. You are to break the curse. Whatever that means.
(satirically)
Honestly, why does Ahtohallan always have to be so cRyPtiC.

Yelena walks off in annoyance and starts singing to herself:

YELENA (CONT'D)
~DIVE DOWN DEEP INTO HER SOUND

ELSA
~BUT NOT TOO FAR, OR YOU'LL BE DROWNED

Yelena quickly seizes Elsa's hand.

YELENA
How do you know?

ELSA
Huh?

YELENA
How do you know my lullaby?

A quake interrupts them, knocking both of them off their feet, rumbling the leaves of the forest. Yelena freezes.

## 12 - Giants

### Running to the Giants

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST - DUSK #83#

A blurry autumn sun prepares to set, ridging the cotton candy sky. But large shapes cast silhouettes against the sky and shadows against the ground.

.QUICK CUTS BETWEEN BOTH CAMPSITES: #84#

The ground trembles irregularly in varying magnitudes. Both groups of locals are still and silent in fear.

RUNEARD
(whispers furiously)
The stone giants never come out this early!

Both campsites hurriedly extinguish their fires, cover their smoke, then scramble to hide.

Kristoff accidentally knocks over some shields. The clinking echoes throughout the silent Forest.

KRISTOFF
Oops.

AERIAL SHOT: Two towering stone giants roar with a deep, ancient growl. The roar ripples across the tree canopy, sending bird-hybrids flying.

They swing towards the sound of the shields, snapping trees like toothpicks in the process, and approach the Arendellian campsite and the dam.

EXT. NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE, CAMPFIRE - DUSK #85#

Elsa's eyes widen, and she stops in her tracks.

ELSA
Huh. So those are the stone giants.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

Elsa quizzically looks at the giants. She sets down the supplies she was carrying, then strides out of the campsite towards the giants.

EXT. ARENDELLIAN CAMPSITE - DUSK #86#

Anna shoos a wild reindeer into the cover of the forest; suddenly she instinctively dives behind a tree. Just in time -- from a hole in the canopy, one of the giants nearly spots her. She exhales in relief.

Just then, a something whistles through the sky.

BOOM! A large boulder crashes very close, sending enough earth flying for Anna to shield her face.

RUNEARD
(to Mattias)
They're going to hit the dam, and we can't do anything about it!

ELSA

is halfway across when she sees Anna and the dam in danger. Elsa starts firing all she has at the giants.

The stone giants are... tickled? But it was enough to draw their attention, so they swing around towards the Northuldra camp instead.

ANNA

sees this, and starts running towards her sister.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
Wait, Anna!

Anna couldn't hear him. She was already gone.

MATTIAS

huffed, impressed at the sisters. He turns back around.

MATTIAS
Soldiers! Let's g --

RUNEARD
(hushes)
We can't risk the lives of our soldiers for Queen Elsa's reckless actions.

MATTIAS
My king, but your granddaughters are in danger!

The two mens' eyes dart wildly as they hurriedly thought up something to say. Mattias' eyes brightened first.

MATTIAS (CONT'D)
I know my way around the Forest. Let me go alone -- I can get them back safely.

RUNEARD
(beat; nods)
Keep your guard up.

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST, CLEARING - DUSK #87#

Elsa and the giants have a firefight with rocks and ice. She intends to put up walls on the defensive, but the ice isn't blasting at her command.

She has a few close calls, saved only by coincidence. The two giants are too intense to take on herself.

EXT. ARENDELLE CAMPSITE OUTSKIRTS - DUSK #88#

Kristoff and Sven race up to a fully-geared Mattias running out of breath -- he reluctantly accepts a lift.

### Plan of Attack

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST, CLEARING - DUSK #89#

A thrown boulder overshadows Elsa. She outstretches her hands to blast it... but nothing comes out. She tries again, to no avail. The shadow gets darker...

At the last moment, Anna arrives and pulls her out. BOOM! They tumble out together with the debris.

ELSA
Anna! What are you doing here! You'll get hurt!

ANNA
(scoffs)
Really?!

Kristoff and Mattias arrive, with Sven drifting to a stop. Mattias jumps off gracefully, sword and shield and all.

MATTIAS
They're old magic, not even the Northuldra can fight them!

ELSA
So what can we do?

MATTIAS runs off and starts banging on his shield with his sword. BANG! BANG! BANG! He fades ever so softer into the distance.

Anna and Elsa turn to Kristoff for an answer.

KRISTOFF
Did you guys know he does the reindeer voice thing too?

The sisters look worriedly at each other.

A GIANT'S FOOT LANDS right beside them with a THUMP! They yelp in terror -- but the giant was blind to them, as if they were not there.

The giant cranes around, looking towards where Mattias is making noise. Anna circles around, and understands the plan.

ANNA
We need to divide their attention, and draw them away from the dam!

They all nod, before splitting off.

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST, FOREST LINE - MOMENTS LATER #90#

Mattias has the focal attention of both the giants. He keeps up the racket, walking backwards, leading them away... until his foot is caught on a root. He falls on his back, looking up at the two enraged giants.

They pick up boulders, wind back their shoulders, and follow through... but a harsh noise causes them to squirm their arm at the last second, causing their projectile to fall short.

KRISTOFF AND SVEN

lead a herd of wild reindeer to run laps around the giants' toes. They let out a cacophony of wolf-like cry, startling the giants, throwing off their balance.

KRISTOFF
(imitating a wolf)
A-wooooo!
(shouting to Mattias)
Don't be afraid to have a little fun!

Mattias raises his eyebrows in amusement.

ELSA

sends a consistent barrage of ice spikes towards the giants, renewing her own confidence.

One giant winds up a boulder to throw at her...

A horn blows. The boulder falls wayside. Elsa turns to se --

YELENA

perched on a tree some distance away, also joining in the racket. They exchange smiles.

EXT. ARENDELLIAN CAMPSITE - DUSK #91#

Runeard sees the stone giants start to move away from the dam.

RUNEARD
It's working! They're... working together...

### Saving Kristoff

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST - DUSK #92#

The stone giants let out an annoyed roar. One of them plucks Kristoff from Sven, and plays around with him like a ragdoll.

KRISTOFF
Uhhhhhh AHHHHHH!

ELSA
(shooting)
Put him down!

ANNA (O.S.)
Hey! It is NOT nice to throw people!

A miserable pebble bounces off the back of the stone giant.

ANNA

is sitting on top of a tree, another pebble in hand, though suddenly abashed.

Everyone, including the giants, pause: did Anna really just try that?

KRISTOFF's POV: He is still hanging upside down, dizzying himself as he flails around.

KRISTOFF
(hanging upside down)
SOMEONE SAVE ME!!!

MATTIAS

looses himself and resumes his noisemaking, desperately shouting too. He jumps into action: he runs towards the giants.

The giants start launching boulders straight at him. The king's guard expertly dodges and dives, making his way to the giant's foot.

EVERYONE

is thoroughly amazed. They keep up the noise and distractions, inching both giants away from the dam.

MATTIAS

starts scaling the giant's body and up the hand that held Kristoff, though hanging on for dear life as the giant tries to shake him off.

He hacks at the giant's arm with his sword, and pulls back to see his own sword dented. But slowly the giant releases its grip.

KRISTOFF
Keep doing that!

ELSA

is busy with the other giant when she hears the

MYSTERIOUS VOICE
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

She freezes in place, looking down at her hands. Yelena sees her and stops too. Elsa's eyes widen.

ELSA
(realizing)
I'm old magic, too.
(shouting to Mattias)
Hey! Incoming!

Elsa turns to the main giant and quickly materializes an ice slide leading up to Kristoff... but a boulder from the other giant looms towards her.

She jumps out of the way, causing her ice construct to veer off course.

MATTIAS

sees the ice slide shooting right towards him! SHUNK!

He lets go of the giant, narrowly avoiding being bisected. He tumbles to the ground with a tuck and roll.

MATTIAS
HEY!

Elsa panics. Her own attention is divided between the two giants. But both their attention is on her. Rocks are falling all around her like meteors, forcing her on the defensive.

MATTIAS

hacks away at the giant's leg, doing no damage. The giant roars and tosses Kristoff high into the air.

KRISTOFF
AHHHHH!

CLACK! The giant reaches down for Mattias. He decides to escape in between the giant's legs, but the giant's hands are about to crush him...

ANNA

appears, riding Sven up along the bent-over body of the stone giant. The giant is pushed downwards, causing it to miss Mattias, allowing him to escape getting crushed.

ANNA
(to Kristoff)
Take my hand!

Kristoff, in free-fall, extends his hand. The giant stands up. As if on a ramp, Anna bucks Sven to leap off the giant...

In slow motion, Anna soars across the sky and meets Kristoff... their hands connect... Anna pulls him onto Sven... they land on the opposite giant, and slide down it.

As if a stunt vehicle, Sven drifts to a stop.

ANNA
(rubbing Sven)
Good boy!
(to Kristoff)
Are you okay?

KRISTOFF
(still dizzy)
Roses... crocus...

Kristoff faints. Mattias backpedals over to her.

MATTIAS
That was very brave of you... and very risky. But somehow you did it.

ANNA
Well, I thought that was very brave, and risky of you, too!

Mattias is taken aback, and dumbly watches Anna as she nonchalantly gathers a few more rocks and charges head-on towards the giants.

### Killing the Giants

ELSA

slowly recovers her pace, as the rest of the gang adeptly lure the giants away while dodging flying boulders.

YELENA
We're almost far enough!

The first giant howls louder than ever before. It brings its fists up... and down. It sends a tremendous earthquake that knocks everyone off their feet. The Forest itself becomes a hurricane of leaves.

The giant fixates its eyes on Elsa, and starts charging towards her like a murderous bull, shaking the earth with every stomp. It overshadows Elsa.

ANNA (O.S.)
ELSA!!!

Death flashes before Elsa's eyes. She screams.

Mist swirls around her, charging up... she lets loose a massive blinding explosion cone of ice.

**FWAMMMMMMMMMM!!!!**

The giant crumbles backwards, dwarfed by a blizzard of snow... a shape spins out of the storm... it's the giant's crystallized arm.

**THUD!** It lands right next to the Northuldra campsite. A snow cloud erupts from the crash site.

THE STONE GIANTS

bellow in horror, retreating into the woods.

ELSA
Wait! I didn't mean to hurt you!

MATTIAS

drops all his gear to the ground, breathless and trembling.

MATTIAS
Her magic... is very, very dangerous.

## 13 - Scarf

### Strong Magic

EXT. GIANT'S ARM RUINS - NIGHT #93#

The sun dips below the horizon just as Elsa pushes through the dense snow cloud surrounding the ruins of the GIANT'S SEVERED ARM.

ANNA
There you are, Elsa, you scared me to death!

ELSA
Stay there!

Anna stops.

ELSA (CONT'D)
My magic is tied to -- stronger than -- the magic of those stone giants. If those giants could destroy entire forests.... I will destroy Arendelle.

Elsa's hands are still shivering with cold blue energy.

ANNA
(approaches)
Elsa, you can't believe tha --

ELSA
(weakly)
Stop! My magic is strong. Not in a good way. Mother, Father, you -- I've led everyone around me to death.

ANNA
(softens)
Father and Mother loved you. I love you.

ELSA
I know. But I'm no good at loving you back.

Anna's heartbroken. She considers. She digs her satchel to pull out Iduna's scarf.

ANNA
(beat)
I... know. And I guess I'll have to live with it, because I love you too much for that to matter.

Elsa squirms... but allows Anna to wrap the scarf around her. Anna's warm hands seemed to calm the smoking glow of her own. Elsa looses up.

### The Ice Memories

The snow cloud finally dissipates, revealing a field of BEAUTIFUL ICE STATUES, somehow sculpted from the ruins next to the River. They walk closer together to inspect them.

BOTH
Whoa...

ELSA
My ice... did this?

ANNA
I told you your ice creations are beautiful.

OLAF
I'd like to think so too!

Both the sisters get a scare. One of the figures was actually Olaf.

ELSA
Olaf, you scared us!

Kristoff and Sven enter the scene. Kristoff slightly woozy.

KRISTOFF
This... is some of the best ice I've ever seen. And as an ice harvester, I've seen plenty.

ANNA
These statues look so... real. Look, this one is even hiding behind this same tree!

ELSA
This looks... like the battle they fought here 34 years ago.

ANNA
What's that thing you said, Olaf?

Sven tiptoes over to the River to sip water.

OLAF
(gesturing to Sven)
Oh, yeah. Water has memory. The water that makes up you and me has passed through at least 4 humans and/or animals before us.
(Sven gags)
And remembers *everything*.

They nod awkwardly, and walk on to surround the FINAL SCULPTURE at the end: it's a boy being pushed aside by a girl standing in his place as a "wave" crashes down on them.

KRISTOFF
This girl saved this boy from the River, and they both are about to get swept away.

ANNA
(curious)
They... do we know them?

MATTIAS (O.S.)
You wouldn't recognize him, like this.

Mattias enters, walking closer, cautious but dumbfounded.

MATTIAS (CONT'D)
He's much younger. That's... your father. Prince Agnarr.
(beat)
Being saved by... a Northuldra girl?

YELENA (O.S.)
Ye --

Yelena leads two dozen Northuldra to circle the gang. Mattias instinctively draws his sword and stands between them.

YELENA
(paying no mind, to Elsa)
That's a Northuldra scarf you're wearing, Elsa. The same one as the girl's from this ice memory.

True enough: the girl was wearing the exact same scarf.

ANNA & ELSA
Our mother was... Northuldra.

Everyone exchanges glances. Mattias backs down. They simmer in the revelation.

Yelena nods to the Northuldra, who connect their hands, forming a spiral with Yelena in the middle, around the gang.

They sing an a capella Vuelie in increasing voices.



>~"Iduna's Scarf" (Original)<

YELENA
~NA NA NA HEYANA

NORTHULDRA
~HAHIYAHA NAHA
~NAHEYA HEYA NA YANUWA
~HANAHE YUNUWANA

The leaves in the trees and the ice statues start to take a neon blue glow. The Forest seemed to be sing along.

NORTHULDRA (CONT'D)
~NA NA NA HEYANA
~HAHIYAHA NAHA
~NAHEYA HEYA NA YANUWA
~HANAHE YUNUWANA

Mattias shifts uncomfortably. Olaf awkwardly takes his hand.

NORTHULDRA (CONT'D)
~NUWA NU
~NUWA HEYA NU
~NUWA NU
~NUWA HEYA NU
~NUWA NU
~NUWA NU

Anna and Elsa draw deep breaths in catharsis. The voices climax.

NORTHULDRA (CONT'D)
~NA NA NA HEYANA
~HAHIYAHA NAHA
~NAHEYA HEYA NA YANUWA
~HANAHE YUNUWANA

YELENA
We are the people of the sun. We seek for all truths to come to light.
(beat)
Hah! A union between Arendelle and Northuldra. That's how Ahtohallan wishes to break the curse.

Yelena trails towards Elsa.

YELENA (CONT'D)
Your powers are a gift of peace, my bitsóóké. You must follow the voice: continue North to Ahtohallan itself!

ANNA
But Yelena... our parents failed to reach Ahtohallan through the Dark Sea. If they can't... how do we?

ELSA
The voice isn't telling me words or directions... it's just this... melody -- and I'm not getting any closer to being "one with my magic".

YELENA
As much as what the voice says, consider who it belongs to.

### The Path Ahead

EXT. NORTHULDRA CAMPSITE - MUCH LATER #94#

The gang are packing supplies with aid of the Northuldra. Yelena talks with Elsa off in the background.

ANNA
Come with us! I want to spend time with my fiancé!

Kristoff scrunches and looks over her shoulder at Mattias, who was inconspicuously fascinated with Northuldra's campsite.

KRISTOFF
There's... some unfinished business I have to take care of.

Anna twists around to see Mattias softly chuckle at the Northuldra fabrics.

MATTIAS
(distant)
This weave and material is amazing!

ANNA
(to Kristoff)
Make sure they stay at peace!
(nods)
Oh Kristoff, I'm going to miss you!

Anna goes for a bear hug.

KRISTOFF
Heh. I know you'll be back soon. Besides, we have our rings so we won't forget each other. It's a symbol of my promise to you forever. I'll be here at the dam, ready, waiting for your triumphant return!

Anna beams the widest, brightest smile. They embrace again.

.AT THE CAMPFIRE  #95#

Yelena prods Elsa with the blunt end of her knitting stick.

YELENA
Iduna, your mother... what was she like?

ELSA
Well. She never sings the lullaby in front of Father, but when my powers get out of control, the lullaby sometimes calms me down. I hope to be a Queen and a mother just like her.

Yelena nods.

ELSA (CONT'D)
Why can't you come with us?

YELENA
(laughs)
I have a people to take care of, Elsa...
(beat)
Remember what I said about secrets being more dangerous than magic?

Elsa tilts her head, but leans in.

YELENA (CONT'D)
Let me tell you a secret.
(pause)
Truth, is more *powerful* than magic. Love... is more *beautiful*.

## 15 - Shipwreck

### Reviving Lost Memories

EXT. BARREN COAST - DAY

Elsa wanders across a hilly wasteland, cupping her ears and spinning around like an ant sniffing pheromones. Anna traces her steps.

ELSA
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

OLAF
AHHHHHHHHHHH

Olaf's poor mimicry of a shriek startles the sisters.

ANNA
Hey Olaf, umm, Maybe just one of you should do it

OLAF
I agree. She's a little pitchy.

A gust of mist ruffles their dresses.

OLAF
Guys...?

It trails behind a hill, revealing... a splintering Crow's Nest.

ELSA
What?

Doom sets in their eyes as the sisters sprint over the hill to reveal...

EXT. HILLTOP, BARREN COAST - DAY

A parched SHIPWRECK with an exposed hull, tattered sails and fractured masts. One flag bears the ARENDELLIAN CROCUS INSIGNIA.

The sisters tremble in confusion and anguish.

OLAF
What is it?

ANNA
A royal vessel. Our parents' ship.

OLAF
But this is the northern Dark Sea, not the Southern Sea.

Elsa races towards the shipwreck, Anna close behind.

INT. SHIPWRECK - DAY

FROM THEIR POV it's a dead corpse of a ship: dark and barren. The interior has been devoured just like the outside, so each room melds into the next.

Elsa shakes her head in disbelief.

ELSA
The voice said only *we* could get through the mist, which means... nobody was on the ship.

Through quivering lips, their eyes started to water. Elsa turns away sniffling, red with shame.

OLAF (O.S.)
Hey, the lock on this is broken!

INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN, SHIPWRECK - DAY

Olaf pulls a small treasure chest to the middle of the "room". The sisters peer inside: it only contained a single leatherbound BOOK.

ANNA
It's only a little damp!

Elsa flips through the pages.

ELSA
It's Mother's handwriting! Written in Ancient Northuldra glyphs.

ANNA
Hmmph. Now what?

Elsa closes her eyes and concentrates on the pages of IDUNA's JOURNAL.

Water droplets start to collect on the pages. They lift off from the pages, growing in size with the moisture from the air. Anna and Olaf's eyes light up in wonder.

They combine and solidify into shapes of ICE... taking the shape of Agnarr and Iduna in the cabin, PANICKING... a freeze-frame of WHIPLASH as the ship breaks apart...

The ice turns darker... a familiar FLURRY of fear starts to form...

ELSA
I can't!!!

ANNA
Mother and Father sailed to Ahtohallan because that's how much they loved you. Don't be afraid of your powers again. I never was!

Through the small blizzard, Anna wraps Iduna's scarf around Elsa. It softens the storm and strengthens Elsa's control.

Elsa doubles down on willpower... the water morphs into promising shapes... with one last effort, she pulls the cloud into her, crumpling onto her knees.

The chaotic scene materializes again, but this time it forms completely and settles: the ship was tipping and water rising -- **moments before it sank**. Through Iduna's sculpture's unmoving lips, her disembodied voice speaks:

IDUNA
Agnarr... if this is really it... I need to tell you who I *really* am...

The show finally resolves to REST. A beat. Elsa gets up.

ANNA
How could Mother not have told Father that she was Northuldra? How many more secrets does she need to hide?

.FLASHBACK

In a frozen ballroom, a young red-haired child flies off a snow slope and across the air. A blue bolt SLAMS her in the forehead.

YOUNG ELSA
ANNA!!!!

Young Elsa's eyes widen in fear. We zoom in on her EYES.

MATCH CUT TO:

.IN THE PRESENT

Elsa looks away once more, this time biting her lip.

ELSA
Time is ticking -- let's search the ship for clues --

ANNA
Good idea! Where --

Anna approaches her but Elsa doesn't meet her eyes.

ELSA
You start from the bow, I'll search around the stern. We'll be quicker.

ANNA
Elsa... you know you can tell me anything, right?

ELSA
(quickly)
Yes. Let's just quickly find what's really going on here.

Elsa walks off towards the stern, flipping through the journal. The last page reads: **"FIND THE KEY"**.

Elsa riffles back to the start and SINGS:

### Elsa's Entreaty

>~"I Seek The Truth" (Unchanged Outtake)<

ELSA
~MOTHER, I AM FLIPPING THROUGH THE PAST
~TURNING PAGES OF A BOOK TO FIND YOU
~MOTHER, I AM LOST, MOTHER, I AM SCARED
~MOTHER, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
~WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO SAY?
~MUST'VE WRITTEN IT DOWN FOR A REASON
~MUST'VE THOUGHT I'D FIND IT SOMEDAY

Elsa closes the journal and instead inspects the ship. Barrels and decor and any signs of life were drained and unsaturated. Not even moss grows inside this graveyard.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~I FEEL THIS POWER SURGING THROUGH ME
~EVERY MINUTE, LIKE A HORSE THAT'S GONE WILD
~MOTHER, YOU WERE HERE, MOTHER YOU ARE GONE
~AND YOU LEFT BEHIND A SCARED CHILD
~CAN'T SIT AROUND AND CRY
~THERE'S TOO MUCH TO LOSE
~AND I THINK THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN THIS POWER FOR A REASON
~AND I NEED TO KNOW WHY

EXT. DECK, SHIPWRECK - DAY

Elsa bathes in sunlight, which only highlights the contrast.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~I SEEK THE TRUTH
~WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME? I'M READY TO HEAR
~CAN'T GO FORWARD THIS WAY
~WITH QUESTIONS GROWING DAY BY DAY
~I SEEK THE TRUTH
~WHAT ARE YOU SHOWING ME? I'M READY TO SEE
~I NEED TO KNOW WHO YOU WERE
~TO KNOW WHO I AM MEANT TO BE

INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN, SHIPWRECK - DAY

Elsa talks to the ice sculptures of her parents, clutching Iduna's scarf tightly.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~MOTHER, YOU WERE EVERYONE'S QUEEN
~I WATCHED YOU CLOSELY, AND YOU TAUGHT ME WELL
~HOW DO I BE YOU? HOW DO I BE GOOD?
~HOW DO I BE ME AND ARENDELLE?
~HOW DO I GOVERN THIS LAND
~WITH A POWER INSIDE THAT I CAN'T COMMAND
~IT'S GROWING AND SPEAKING A LANGUAGE
~THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

Elsa goes back to the journal and revives various memories, like the one from the Giant's Arm Ruins where teenage Iduna saves teenage Agnarr during the Battle.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~AND I SEEK THE TRUTH
~WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING ME? I'M READY TO LEARN
~CAN'T RETREAT ONCE AGAIN
~AND SO I'D TURN TO YOU BACK THEN
~I SEEK THE TRUTH
~YOU LEFT ME MESSAGES AND THEY HOLD A KEY
~I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN
~TO KNOW WHO YOU WANT ME TO BE

### Anna's Resolve

INT. BOW-END OF THE HULL, SHIPWRECK - DAY

Anna throws around different objects in the room.

ANNA
ANOTHER SECRET, AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER
~AT LEAST YOU WERE CONSISTENT

From her POV, she's been peeking into captain's cabin (with the ice sculpture of her parents) between line-of-sights through broken walls within the hull.

ANNA (CONT'D)
~HELLO, FATHER, HELLO, MOTHER

Anna gazes longingly at Elsa, who was so deep into the journal.

ANNA (CONT'D)
~BUT I WON'T LET THAT PULL US BACK
~TO WHAT WE WERE BEFORE
~I WON'T LET HER CLOSE THAT DOOR
~NO MORE DOORS ANYMORE

.WITH ALTERNATING POVs

Elsa suddenly CATCHES something in one of the pages, and scrutinizes closer. Anna's given up on her search -- she creeps closer to Elsa.

ELSA
~WHERE THE NORTH WIND MEETS THE SEA

ANNA^
~NO MORE SECRETS

ELSA
~THERE'S A RIVER FULL OF MEMORY

ANNA^
~STAY TOGETHER, YOU'RE MY FAMILY

ELSA
~COME, MY DARLING, HOMEWARD BOUND

ANNA^
~I JUST FOUND YOU

ELSA
~HOMEWARD BOUND

ANNA^
~YOU'LL STAY FOUND

Elsa holds up a journal page to the light: *this is the one.* She carefully pulls the droplets form that page.

ELSA
~I SEEK THE TRUTH
~YOU DREW A MAP FOR ME, YOU LEFT ME A CLUE
~YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME ALONE
~YOU'RE WITH ME GUIDING WHAT I DO
~I SEEK THE TRUTH

ANNA
ELSA

ELSA^
~THEY SAY THAT IT CAN HURT, BUT EVEN SO

ANNA
~ELSA
‏
‏

ELSA^
~I NEED TO KNOW WHO YOU WERE
~SO I CAN KNOW WHO I AM
~AND I WON'T LET IT

Elsa controls the ice with strained muscles -- this one takes SPECIAL EFFORT.

ANNA
~I WON'T LET YOU

BOTH^
GO

ANNA
~I WON'T LET YOU

BOTH^
~GO

### Elsa's Midpoint Revelation

A sculpture of Iduna forms in between the two sisters. Mist and sunbeams cast a spotlight on it.

IDUNA
(whispering)
We've buried Elsa's map. We've locked away Elsa's key. But in Ahtohallan all is found. And **she** will break the curse and lift the mist.

The last line echoes.

Elsa dumbly takes it in. Then she storms out of the ship. *Oh no,* Anna thinks, *not again*, and chases her.

EXT. HILLTOP, BARREN COAST - DAY

Anna finally catches up to Elsa on the top of the hill. Elsa... is beaming ear-to-ear?

ANNA
Elsa?

ELSA
Mother and Father didn't die trying to cure me! They were sailing to Ahtohallan to find out how to lift the wall of mist of the Forest.
(beat)
And they know I'm a part of it somehow. They… always believed that my powers were for good.

She spins around in catharsis.

ELSA (CONT'D)
No one needs to break any dams! Yelena said if I become one with my magic, I will break the curse. *That's* why the voice is leading me to Ahtohallan. I was born *for* this.

ANNA
Just as I always believed.

The sisters hug it out, and linger.

ANNA
Great! Let's go to Ahto-whatsit-land!

ELSA
(pauses)
What? No. No! Anna, the Dark Sea is too dangerous for you.

ANNA
What? Elsa, you're losing control of your powers!

ELSA
Then, I would need to take care of them, while taking care of you.

ANNA
I can take care of myself -- *and* of you too -- just fine!
(beat)
Besides, we should approach it carefully. Find a safer way across.

ELSA
Anna, our people are stranded, homeless on a cliff. The tensions between the Northuldra and the Arendellians at the Dam are heating up. My powers are growing weaker by the minute. I need to act now.
(thinking)
I'm going to ice bridge myself across the Sea. The waves will break them because they're very fragile now, and I might fall in a couple of times -- what if I accidentally strike you in the heart again?

ANNA
We can thaw me again now that we know how to!

ELSA
Tell me, Anna, realistically -- how are you going to help me get across?

ANNA
Elsa! We promised to do this together! You promised.”

ELSA
I... did promise...
(beat)
But I'm not perfect like you, Anna. My little sister throws herself at swords and giants for other people. I just don't have that capacity.

Elsa smiles warmly, then puts on a serious face.

### The Sisters' Difference

ELSA (CONT'D)
You need to band together the Arendellians and Northuldra at the Forest. You can show the people a way without fear… I can't do that like you do.

Anna recoils in surprise. Disbelief. She gives a soft smile.

ELSA (CONT'D)
I always mess things up. My magic might be the answer to the curse, but they might've also caused the curse in the first place.

ANNA
(confused)
There -- there's gotta be some way for us to do it together!

ELSA
You know that my love for you might just measure up to half of your love for me. I really wish we could do this together but I need to leave for just a while, Anna... I need to know how to master my powers, how to reach my true purpose -- whatever it is.

ANNA
I don't want to stop you from being whatever you need to be! I just don't want you dying trying to be everything for everyone else too. Don't do this alone -- it's dangerous!

ELSA
When you sacrificed your life to save mine three years ago, you knew it was dangerous! You trusted in your voice. Now I'm trusting in mine.

ANNA
We lost Mother and Father in this Sea. I -- I can't lose you too, Elsa.

Elsa embraces her.

ELSA
I can't lose you either.

She calls Olaf into the hug.

ELSA
(to Olaf)
Come on.

They linger. It's sweet.

Suddenly, Anna and Olaf start speeding away from Elsa -- she had conjured an ice boat, sending them backwards.

ANNA
HEY!!

Elsa doesn't turn around.


# ACT 2B


## 16 - River

### The River Cynicism

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Anna and Olaf zoom through the Forest in the ice boat on an ice track that kept extending itself.

ANNA
No, nonono... we're going backwards! Olaf, help me stop -- give me a hand!

Olaf hands her -- his wooden twig-hand.

Anna sticks it into the ground, halting the boat -- but it just PIVOTS and wildly SWINGS the boat sideways off the ice path.

BOTH
AHHHH!!!

They slide off a ramp and splash into:

EXT. RIVER - DAY

A flowing river with high banks. Their boat gently moves downstream. Anna huffs roughly.

ANNA
ARGHHHH!!!

OLAF
(cautiously)
Anna, this is might sounds crazy, but I'm -- sensing some rising anger.

ANNA
Oh, I AM angry, Olaf! She promised me we do this together.

OLAF
Yeah, but... what I mean is I'm sensing rising anger in me.

ANNA
(pauses)
Wait, you're angry?

OLAF
I think so. Elsa pushed me away too, and didn't even say goodbye.

>~"When I'm Older (Reprise)" (New Reprise)<

OLAF
~THIS HAS ALL MADE SENSE NOW THAT I'M OLDER!
~TODAY'S THE DAY WHERE EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE
~NOW THAT I'M OLD AND WISE, I'M BEGINNING TO REALIZE:
~THAT WHEN YOU'RE OLDER, ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE!

Anna has to double-take to study him. This isn't the Olaf she's always known. But he's also very familiar.

ANNA
Olaf. I understand why you are mad at her. People make mistakes. A lot.

OLAF
Like the Trolls said, people make bad choices when they're mad or scared or stressed. But we've thrown so much love her way, and we still haven't fixer'ed her upper!

ANNA
Well. I don't know. When people don't really change, our love for them mustn't change either.

OLAF
You've said some things never changed, but since then everything done's nothing but change. I feel like changing too.

One half of Olaf's face starts to SAG, ever so subtly.

ANNA
No, no! See -- I'm still here holding your hand!

OLAF
(suddenly unfazed)
Yeah, I think that's a good point. Anna, I feel better, you're such a good listener.

Anna sighs in relief.

### The Giants' Cave

EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

/* They reach a fork where their river joins up with another, more powerful river. */
They encounter a parallel-running river —- with STRONGER currents.

OLAF
Look! That other river sorta flows into that deep, scary cave!

Anna spots a VERY SMOOTH BOULDER that was holding back the water and distributing the water current.

ANNA
Actually, if that big boulder fell, the cave could get flooded.

Their boat veers sharply, picking up speed.

BOTH
WHOA!!!

They were caught by the stronger currents of the other river, and are suddenly accelerating towards the cave.

Up-close, the exterior of the cave was etched with SKULL AND DANGER SYMBOLS. LARGE CRACKS and TAPS OF SAND ran all along its large entrance.

ANNA
...Olaf!!!!

Anna looks ahead: the river drops deep and dark down...

They desperately paddle against the current, but the current only gets stronger.

Their ice boat tips... and falls into darkness.

BOTH
AHHHHH!!!

INT. POOL, CAVE

The pair slide down and are washed up in a pool at the base of the waterfall.

ANNA
No, no!

Anna tries to climb back the way they fell from. It wasn't too steep, but the currents were too strong for her. They climb themselves onto land, soaking wet.

ANNA
(loudly)
Oh, GREAT! How are we going to get out of --

OLAF^
This is the WORST! I'm going to --

They both zip their mouths. They hear -- feel, deep grumblings of large beasts.

Anna finds some dry wood, and with some flint from her pouch, strikes a torch...

They turn around slowly and see... a STONE GIANT. Behind him, two, three, five --

ANNA
(whispering)
The giants... they sleep right here, in the caves.

OLAF
Good thing they're deep in sleep, or we'd be deep in their bellies.

ANNA
We need to find another way out.

Olaf stands by a tunnel opening.

OLAF
Perhaps the way out is through this spooky, pitch-black way in.

Anna pouts a face. She agrees and they walk through the tunnel.

OLAF
(fading out)
Come on, it'll be fun! Assuming we don't get stuck here forever and no one ever find us...

## 14 - Reindeer

### Slipping Out

EXT. ARENDELLIAN CAMPSITE - DAWN #96#

Runeard, Mattias and Kristoff sit around a table, finishing their breakfast of unusual dishes. Kristoff sneaks carrots to Sven, who was hiding behind a wall.

RUNEARD
When you hadn't returned yet, I feared the worst for you, Lieutenant.

KRISTOFF
You should've been there! There was lights, and magic, and then everyone started singing...

Runeard furrows his brows. Mattias noisily clears his throat. Kristoff belatedly gets the signal.

MATTIAS
(darkly)
The Northuldra are more dangerous than the stone giants. 34 years doesn't change the truth.
(impromptu)
I would be foolish to return while your granddaughters were still in their camp.

Runeard eyes them both... then blinks his eyes tiredly, satisfied.

RUNEARD
We all saw how powerful Queen Elsa is to take down a stone giant. If she is not controlled, then everything we've fought for, everyone we love --
(turning to Kristoff)
--is already lost.

Kristoff shakes his head, unconvinced.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
(shrugs)
I trust Princess Anna to find the *right* way to lift the mist. Until then--

Runeard stands up to address the entire camp. They fall silent as he starts.

RUNEARD (CONT'D)
Stone giants are coming out during the evening! Arendelle is evacuated! The Northuldra will try to break the dam. So, increase the fortifications! Sharpen your swords! KEEP. YOUR. GUARD. UP!

Everyone disperses like a broken hornet's nest. Yet in the chaos, Mattias looks around, pulls some carrots from lunch and slips out of the main campsite. Kristoff and Sven follow.

EXT. DAM - DAY #97#

Mattias crosses the river over the dam, nodding to soldiers who salute in response. Kristoff and Sven not far behind.

EXT. NORTHULDRA FOREST - DAY #98#

Mattias weaves through a familiar path.

He turns around --

Kristoff spins behind a tree just in time. Sven poorly mimics a rough, wild reindeer. Mattias cautiously carries on.

LATER

A group of wild reindeer are grazing. PAN to reveal Mattias stalking them from a bush. PAN to reveal Kristoff stalking Mattias, in turn.

Mattias tosses them some carrots. The reindeer get spooked -- but inspect the carrots anyways.

Mattias comes out of hiding, approaching the unaware reindeer... hand stretched out... closer...

The wild reindeer spin around, suddenly face-to-face with Mattias.

MATTIAS
You're strong enough to take off my head... but

### Elsa Attempting

EXT. COAST, DARK SEA - EVENING

/* A massive wave beats down on a gray shore. It's gloomy and thunderstorming. The wave recedes to reveal: */

The DARK SEA is TUMULTUOUS, GLOOMY, and most importantly: infinitely-stretching beyond the horizon.

Elsa shakes her muscles loose and ties up her hair, as if an athlete before finals. She paces across and bounds towards the ocean.

Just before she hits the water -- out blasts a HAPHAZARD blast of ice, FREEZING OVER the top of the waves. She STRIDES across on the ice, making good distance... BUT:

Up ahead is a TWO-STORY TIDAL WAVE (we will dub as, "the Tall Wave"). She sends fierce ice bolts, but they barely dent the wave. The Tall Wave RISES higher, and even higher, until:

The tectonic plates of ice start cracking -- titanic waves clash and shoot upwards, EXPLODING the makeshift bridge into splinters.

Elsa desperately tries to salvage the floor, but the ocean tears the ice apart. Her feet lose balance on the tipping ice sheet... she SLIPS... she FALLS... the wave CRASHES onto her.

CUT TO:

EXT. COAST, DARK SEA - SOME TIME LATER

Elsa's back on the shore, standing before her run-up, but fully drenched and shivering. She puts on her battle face, and charges towards the ocean again.

This time, as she ice-bridges herself across, she methodically REINFORCES weak CRACKS. It seems to work. Until...

She encounters the Tall Wave again. As looms and grows, Elsa doubles down on her system to conquer this wave. She gains height...

But the ice cracks are just too many, and the wave is stronger, which CRASHES over and down onto her.

She's washed back onto the coast, PANTING, but scrunches her face in ANNOYANCE. It starts thunderstorming.

.MONTAGE: ELSA STRUGGLES WITH THE DARK SEA

- She tries SPEED, creating a NARROW and precarious ice path, gaining a little more height, but it's too thin and she falls backwards from the Tall Wave.

- She tries surfing on a PANEL of ice, propelling herself with "THRUSTERS" shot out from her hands towards her back. A sudden lopsided BURST of thrust lets the Tall Wave easily flip her "surfboard" over.

- She tries ICE-SKATING, Frozone-style, creating ICE TRACKS before her, but as she skates up the vertical incline of the Tall Wave, she loses momentum right at its peak. She washes out.

- She washes up on the beach. Again, and again.

### Elsa Encounters the Nokk

Elsa stands at the start of her runway again, but her hair's all out and her shoulders are caved in. There's no winning.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH --
~BUT NOT TOO FAR, OR YOU'LL BE DROWNED...

She looks up. Around. She looks down, worn out. Closes her eyes. A beat. Takes a deep breath.

She begins a run-up once again. Without the same certainty from her first run, but with the same determination.

She hits the water, and creates her ice path as usual. She encounters the Tall Wave once again. It seemed twice-as-high this time.

But Elsa's not arching backwards to climb the Tall Wave. No, she builds up horizontal speed, charging through like a bull. The Tall Wave meets Elsa once again, but:

EXT. UNDERWATER, DARK SEA

PANNING WHILE FIXED ON ELSA, she draws a DEEP BREATH and we PIERCE straight into the wall of water with her, and the noise of the thunderstorm is instantly DAMPENED from being underwater.

The tumultuous undercurrents PULL her in every direction, while she fights to stay upright. A few chaotic seconds pass, and she manages to push herself out of the water.

EXT. SOMEWHERE, DARK SEA

She GASPS for air -- the noise of the SCREAMING storm returns; the winds and the waves are still BOISTEROUS and TITANIC, but she's made it past the Tall Wave.

Elsa forms an ice PLATFORM and desperately PULLS herself onto it. Just as she's almost up, her hanging foot is harshly DRAGGED back underwater, PLUNGING Elsa.

EXT. UNDERWATER, DARK SEA

Elsa SQUIRMS and BREAKS FREE, but it's too FRANTIC to tell what that was, let alone just breaking the surface of the water --

EXT. SOMEWHERE, DARK SEA - CONTINUOUS

Elsa SPUTTERS for air, SCRAMBLING onto the platform. She finally gets a breath to wonder in WIDE-EYED HORROR, what WAS that?!

A Tall Wave materializes right behind her. It falls. Elsa is readier this time, getting a deep breath before diving under.

EXT. UNDERWATER, DARK SEA - CONTINUOUS

Elsa is free-floating. A DARK SHAPE WHOOSHES in front of the camera. Elsa whips her head, but sees nothing. The dark shape WHIZZES behind her. With a CRACK of LIGHTNING, she turns to see --

**THE NOKK, a fierce HORSE-shaped entity made of WATER and eyes that GLOW, has its SILHOUETTE is dramatically lined by the lightning.**

It rides down towards her. Its hooves PRESS down on her shoulders, pushing her down.

Elsa WRESTLES with it, flipping around, and grabs it by the hooves. Its shape slowly FROSTS up, and it DISSOLVES. Elsa lets out a few bubbles in relief, just when --

Elsa is SHOVED forwards. She looks up to see: the Nokk had REFORMED, angrier than ever. The horse turns around to CHARGE at her again.

Elsa sends ice shards at the Nokk, dissolving it. It REAPPEARS again in the distance, and they go back-and-forth for a few exchanges.

She fatigues and SLOWS down. The Nokk always attacks from above, preventing her from getting a fresh breath from the surface.

DISTANT CHANTING (O.S.)
(roughly)
~NA NA NA HEYANA
~HAHIYAHA NAHA

Elsa confusedly looks around for the chanting. It's only her and the Nokk.

ELSA (V.O.)
I can't kill water.

The Nokk WRAPS itself TIGHTLY around her and DRIVES her down, leaving a VORTEX trail. Elsa STRUGGLES to no avail. Her back hits the seabed, PINNED by the Nokk, and she starts GURGLING.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
(barely intelligible)
~I STILL LOVE YOU...

### Elsa Taming

Her eyes EXPAND wide open in catharsis. She stops gurgling. With an ounce of breath left and a WARRIOR'S face, she PUSHES her hands outwards from her face, like a pupa breaking out of its cocoon.

BUBBLES OF AIR STREAM in towards her... and Elsa BENDS the water around her, creating a POCKET OF AIR. She INHALES deeply. The Nokk looks down, SURPRISED.

Elsa, confidence regained, WRESTLES with the Nokk to resurface. It STRUGGLES back, but Elsa's hands QUELL every pulse of water from the Nokk's VIGOROUS protests.

EXT. SOMEWHERE, DARK SEA

They eventually break through the water surface, and the Nokk SURRENDERS, guided by Elsa's hands' movements and directions. The storm and waves also SUBSIDE, resting into a peaceful, flat expanse of sea.

Elsa swings a leg over to mount the Nokk, materializing a bright blue REINS and attaches them. The Nokk, now subservient and much CALMER, takes large strides across the surface of the still waters.

## 18 - Ahtohallan

### Elsa Searching

EXT. AHTOHALLAN WATERS, DARK SEA - NIGHT

Elsa squints to verify a MAJESTIC MOUNTAIN-ISLAND OF ICE right up ahead.

ELSA
Of course! Glaciers are rivers of ice! Ahtohallan is frozen... *[™ lol]*

MYSTERIOUS VOICE
(gently)
AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

Elsa presses the Nokk on towards Ahtohallan with deep anticipation.



>~"Show Yourself" (Rewritten)<

ELSA
~EVERY INCH OF ME IS TREMBLING
~BUT NOT FROM THE COLD
~SOMETHING IS FAMILIAR
~LIKE A DREAM, I CAN REACH BUT NOT QUITE HOLD
~I CAN SENSE YOU THERE
~LIKE A FRIEND I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN

EXT. SHORE, AHTOHALLAN

Elsa leaps off the Nokk onto the coast. They bow to each other in respect before the Nokk leaps off and merges into the Sea.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~I'M ARRIVING
~AND IT FEELS LIKE I AM HOME

The gargantuan ICE SHELF towers like CASTLE WALLS before Elsa. She nervously approaches an opening in the middle, and enters.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FORTRESS
~COLD SECRETS DEEP INSIDE
~YOU HAVE SECRETS, TOO
~BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE

INT. TUNNELS, AHTOHALLAN

A passageway with walls of ice, eventually leading into a darker room. Elsa searches and spins about, singing to an invisible friend who could be hiding just around any of these walls.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~SHOW YOURSELF
~I'M DYING TO MEET YOU
~SHOW YOURSELF
~IT'S YOUR TURN
~ARE YOU THE ONE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
~ALL OF MY LIFE?
~SHOW YOURSELF
~I'M READY TO LEARN
~AH-AH, AH-AH

Right behind her, the walls LIGHT up in VIBRANT hues of celeste and violet. The Voice finally replies in a new answer melody. The colors WHOOSH down the hallway.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.)
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

Elsa takes off and PURSUES in wonder and newfound conviction. A bright GLOW in the walls leads her down, and she feels the wall as she runs and surfs along.

ELSA
~I'VE NEVER FELT SO CERTAIN
~ALL MY LIFE, I'VE BEEN TORN
~BUT I'M HERE FOR A REASON
~COULD IT BE THE REASON I WAS BORN?

At the end of the hallway, Elsa SLIDES off a ramp, over a void. With effortless swings of her arms, she materializes pillars of ice to hop over the gap and into a tunnel on the opposite side.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO DIFFERENT
~NORMAL RULES DID NOT APPLY
~IS THIS THE DAY?

The glow in the wall runs ahead and illuminates the exit, which is blocked by collapsed SHAFTS OF ICE. Elsa runs towards it...

ELSA (CONT'D)
~ARE YOU THE WAY
~I FINALLY FIND OUT WHY?

INT. COURTYARD, AHTOHALLAN

Elsa BLASTS them away — but they end up NEATLY arranged as the doorframe. The room is littered with thick COLUMNS OF ICE, and Elsa effortlessly waves her hand and uprights them, making the room look like a regal palace.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~SHOW YOURSELF
~I'M NO LONGER TREMBLING
~HERE I AM
~I'VE COME SO FAR
~YOU ARE THE ANSWER I'VE WAITED FOR
~ALL OF MY LIFE

She approaches a large, triangular-shaped DOORFRAME with what seems like a glowing, misty CURTAIN.

A gesture causes the curtain to SHATTER inwards into A BILLION LUMINOUS CRYSTALS, before a PITCH-BLACK CAVERN.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~OH, SHOW YOURSELF
~LET ME SEE WHO YOU ARE

INT. THRONE ROOM, AHTOHALLAN

Elsa shyly steps forward. The crystals form COLORFUL IMAGERY of castles, reindeers, ships, giants. Elsa is just AWESTRUCK at the beauty of it all.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~COME TO ME NOW
~OPEN YOUR DOOR
~DON'T MAKE ME WAIT
~ONE MOMENT MORE
~OH, COME TO ME NOW
~OPEN YOUR DOOR

Elsa gestures for all the crystals to form a giant ICE-SNOWFLAKE with her as its center.

ELSA (CONT'D)
~DON'T MAKE ME WAIT
~ONE MOMENT MORE

### Elsa's Ultimate Revelation

With a determined stomp, a LARGE BEAM OF BRIGHT LIGHT shoots upwards towards the ceiling, WASHING downwards and BATHING the walls of the glorious cavern in LUMINOUS WATER.

Now as bright as day, the walls reveal to be a blurry KALEIDOSCOPE OF MEMORIES, with different scenes involving Elsa's family: Anna, Agnarr, Iduna, Olaf.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (O.S.)
~WHERE THE NORTH WIND MEETS

CHOIR (V.O)^
~WHERE THE NORTH WIND
~MEETS THE SEA

Elsa turns around towards the Voice: it's a MEMORY on the walls, of earlier when Anna had been singing Elsa to sleep with Iduna's lullaby. Instead, Memory-Anna's lips are singing the Mysterious Voice's melodic call.

MEMORY ANNA
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

ELSA^
~NO MORE SECRETS

Elsa huffs and smiles in CATHARSIS. Tears swell.

CHOIR (V.O)
~THERE'S A RIVER

MEMORY ANNA
~AH-AH, AH-AH-AH

ELSA^
~STAY TOGETHER

CHOIR (V.O)
~FULL OF MEMORY

ELSA (SPOKEN)
Anna!

BOTH MEMORY ANNA AND ELSA
~YOU'RE MY FAMILY

Memory Anna looks dearly at Memory Elsa, which frames as if she were looking down at Elsa physically. Here, Memory Anna deviates from actual events: instead of dozing off, she continues singing.

MEMORY ANNA
~COME, MY DARLING, HOMEWARD BOUND

ELSA^
~I JUST FOUND YOU

MEMORY ANNA
HOMEWORK BOUND!

ELSA^
~I AM FOUND!

With a ripple of magic, Elsa's outfit TRANSFORMS into a PURE WHITE DRESS with a translucent royal CAPE.

BOTH
~SHOW YOURSELF

ELSA
~STEP INTO YOUR POWER

BOTH
~HERE I AM

ELSA
~I'M YOURS ONCE MORE!

MEMORY ANNA^
~...I'M YOURS ONCE MORE!

They both sing from the deepest depths of their hearts.

BOTH
~ **I AM** THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR

ELSA
~ALL OF YOUR LIFE

MEMORY ANNA^
~ALL OF YOUR LIFE

ELSA
~SO, SHOW YOURSELF

Elsa SWINGS her arms around dramatically -- a FLURRY OF MIST GROWS and SWIRLS around her. She BELTS the final note as she brings down a blinding WHITEOUT.

MEMORY ANNA
~AH-AH, AH-AH
~AH-AH, AH-AH
~AH-AH, AH-AH

ELSA^
~AH-AH, AH-AH
~AH-AH, AH-AH
~NOW I HAVE COME **HOME**!

## 19 - Drowning

### Secret Memories

ELSA (V.O.)
The Forest... used *Anna's* voice to call me. She is the one to break the curse. Again.

Elsa chuckles warmly. The whiteout fades, revealing:

INT. INFINITY THRONE ROOM, AHTOHALLAN

An INFINITY WHITE ROOM. Elsa takes it all in.

Groups of ANIMATED WATER FIGURINES are spread out across the room. They're like the memories from the shipwreck, but instead of static sculptures, everything is made of MOVING WATER and is ALIVE.

MEMORY ANNA (O.S.)
I like these open gates!

Elsa excitedly turns to the voice -- it was a water-version ANNA MEMORY-FIGURE during the end of Frozen 1. Elsa grimaces in disappointment, but then couldn't help but smile.

MEMORY ELSA
We are never closing them again.

MEMORY KRISTOFF speeds by on a sled pulled by MEMORY SVEN. MEMORY OLAF trails right behind on makeshift skis.

MEMORY KRISTOFF
Look out, reindeer coming through!

MEMORY OLAF^
Hey, guys!

The Skating Memories glide out of earshot.

Looking around, Elsa sees that every group of water-memories are like this: involving her, her family, and her friends. They cause a soft CHATTER in the room.

She walks up to A NORTHULDRA TREE, and at the bottom, a MEMORY OF YOUNG AGNARR stealthily peeking around the trunk. MEMORY TEEN IDUNA JUMPS down from a branch.

MEMORY TEEN IDUNA
Boo!

MEMORY TEEN AGNARR^
AHH!!

They were playing some game of hide-and-seek tag, and now Memory Teen Agnarr takes off chasing her. Elsa grins widely at her parents' innocence.

A "wave" pushes a GROGGY UNIFORMED BOY forward and then recedes. Elsa turns towards the new scene: FIGURES OF SOLDIERS rush forward from COASTAL DOCKS to aid the boy.

MEMORY TEEN AGNARR
...I'm alive?

Elsa pivots around the memory to see a SMALL FIGURE WITH WAVY HAIR watching while hidden under the docks. It's Teen Iduna.

MEMORY YOUNG ANNA (O.S.)
Higher!

Elsa whips around, anxiety crashing onto her. This memory is WHITE-FROSTED instead of pure water, and seemed SOLID and TOUGH.

MEMORY YOUNG ELSA
Slow down! Anna!

The Memory of Young Anna JUMP higher and higher on snow columns. The Memory of Young Elsa, upon a closeup, is actually ANNOYED. Her fists TENSE up.

Elsa sees this, and scrunches in denial... then begrudgingly nods her head.

The Memory of Young Elsa SLIPS backwards, and in instinctive WIDE-EYED HORROR at the Memory of Young Anna soaring through the air, sends a sharp BOLT of ice towards her.

The ice bolt SLAPS Young Anna square on the forehead, rendering her unconscious. She rolls down a snow slope.

MEMORY YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
Anna? ...Mama! Papa!

The unconscious Memory of Young Anna starts to CRYSTALIZE into ice, held in the arms of a weeping Memory of Young Elsa.

Elsa turns away. She can't bear to watch. She fixates on another group of memories:

MEMORY PRIEST
I officially pronounce you husband and wife... King and Queen of Arendelle.

We pull back to reveal that it's Memory Agnarr and Memory Iduna's WEDDING DAY, all dressed up... but their figures are ICY and becoming more TRANSLUCENT.

Elsa turns her attention away to another memory:

MEMORY ELSA (V.O.)
I can't lose you either. Come on.

From just a few hours ago: Memory Anna and Memory Olaf pull into Memory Elsa's hug. Memory Elsa is more ice than water. An ICE BOAT forms under the other two, and whizzes them away.

MEMORY ANNA
HEY!

But Memory Elsa barely reacts or moves -- clearly starting from the heart, the figures crystallize too.

Elsa shakes her head in sorrowful regret.

ELSA
I'm the one with the frozen™ heart.

### Elsa Dives Down

Elsa looks up: she's in the Arendellian campsite in the Forest. MEMORY PAST RUNEARD and MEMORY PAST MATTIAS walk past her. Whose forms are SOLID ICE.

MEMORY PAST MATTIAS
One last brick to complete the dam. To aid the people of magic whom we fear.

MEMORY PAST RUNEARD
Magic is powerful, and powerful means dangerous. So, you can either freeze in fear and lock yourself in your room -- or, you can face your fear... then trick your way into becoming the more powerful than what you fear.

MEMORY PAST MATTIAS
Caution is why you hired me, Your Majesty--

The two Memory Figures descend down a stairwell, trailed by Elsa. Memory Past Runeard pulls out a regional map.

MEMORY PAST RUNEARD
Pre-caution. Did you think it's a coincidence, Lieutenant, that since the dam has been built, our cozy fishing village in the middle of the fjord suddenly has increased in land?

Memory Past Matthias grimaces at this, but doesn't break pace.

INT. UNDERWATER LAKE, AHTOHALLAN

They enter a large, icy cavern. A lake stretches across the ominous room, seemingly infinitely.

MEMORY PAST RUNEARD
Combined with Northuldra's Hurchwood logs and other natural resources, we have flourished to become the central trading port of the region.
